US election security officials reject Trump's fraud claims,"US election officials have said the 2020 White House vote was the ""most secure in American history"", rejecting President Donald Trump's fraud claims. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" a committee announced. They spoke out after Mr Trump claimed without proof that 2.7 million votes for him had been ""deleted"". He has yet to concede to the president-elect, Democrat Joe Biden. The result of the 3 November election was projected by all the major US TV networks last weekend. Mr Biden is now projected to have won Arizona, extending his lead by 11 electoral college votes to a total of 290, with Mr Trump on 217. It is the first time the state has voted Democrat since 1996. Mr Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Meanwhile, China has finally extended its congratulations to Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris after days of silence. ""We respect the choice of the American people,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said. Russia has said it wants to wait for an ""official result"". The announcement marks the most direct rebuttal from federal and state officials of President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Thursday's joint statement was released by the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council - which is made up of senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the US Election Assistance Commission as well as state-level officials who oversee elections and representatives of the voting machine industry. ""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result,"" the group said. ""While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,"" it added, without naming Mr Trump directly. ""When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections."" The statement was posted to the website of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The head of Cisa, Christopher Krebs, has reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over a Cisa website called Rumor Control, which debunks election misinformation. On Thursday, Mr Krebs shared a post by an election law expert that said: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Cisa assistant director Bryan Ware stepped down on Thursday. The White House had asked for his resignation earlier this week, Reuters reports. Mr Krebs expects to be fired, the news agency says.  Hours before the statement was released, Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence for the stunning claim, which appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News and was flagged by Twitter. The claim was linked to the miscounting of votes in one Republican-leaning Michigan county. Unofficial results initially favoured Mr Biden but were later corrected in President Trump's favour. State election officials acknowledged what had happened, saying human error was to blame, rather than a software malfunction. A small but growing number of Republicans are backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, was among those saying Mr Biden should start receiving the secret presidential memo, as is usual with incoming presidents.  Republican Senators Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn and John Thune agreed, although House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Mr Biden was ""not president right now"" and should wait. Between 10 and 20 Republicans in Congress have now either congratulated Mr Biden or accepted there must be moves towards a transition. But most have yet to acknowledge the president-elect's win. A chorus of senior Democrats have condemned this: Capitol Hill reporters say Republican lawmakers are anxious not to alienate the Trump base, given that the president just won more votes than any incumbent ever, even though he is projected to lose. Party bigwigs are also said to be hoping that Mr Trump will help campaign for two Senate run-off elections in January in Georgia that will decide whether Republicans retain control of the upper chamber. Mr Biden is 5.3 million votes ahead of Mr Trump - about 3.4%, and is well beyond the hurdle of 270 electoral college votes required to win the presidency. President Trump has kept a low key public profile since the election. Reports suggest he has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to take on the conservative network Fox News, whose full support he now feels to be lacking. According to CBS News, Mr Trump is also openly discussing a possible 2024 campaign to retake the presidency. On Thursday he spoke with Pope Francis, who offered his ""blessings and congratulations"". Mr Biden will be only the second Roman Catholic president of the US. He also spoke with congressional Democratic leadership about the need for a coronavirus stimulus package as the daily US caseload from the disease soared to a new record of more than 150,000. He spent the day huddled with his transition team in Wilmington, Delaware, where he had been planning cabinet appointments. On Wednesday he picked veteran Democratic operative Ron Klain to be his White House chief of staff.",2020-11-13T08:56:10,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54926084,2020-11-13 14:26:51.953110,BBC,politics,0
Covid: Watchdog urges government to âcome cleanâ over deals,"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter The government was not transparent about suppliers and services when it scrambled to award Â£18bn worth of Covid-19 contracts, the public spending watchdog has said. The National Audit Office (NAO) found firms recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority. It said there was inadequate explanation of key decisions, such as why particular suppliers were chosen.  Nor was enough done to address potential conflicts of interest. Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, called for ministers to ""come clean"" and publish all information about the contracts awarded.  The government acknowledged it had procured services with ""extreme urgency"" due the crisis but it said it had ""robust processes in place"". According to the NAO's report, more than 8,600 coronavirus contracts had been awarded by 31 July, ranging in value from less than Â£100 to Â£410m. Of these, Â£10.5bn-worth were awarded directly without a competitive tender process, the report said. Personal protective equipment (PPE) accounted for 80% of the number of contracts awarded. The report comes after the BBC revealed on Tuesday that a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the pandemic was paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. The consultant, Michael Saiger, had been in line for a further $20m of UK public funds, documents filed in a US court reveal. The legal papers revealed the American supplier of the PPE called the deals ""lucrative"". NAO head Gareth Davies said it remained ""essential that decisions are properly documented and made transparent if government is to maintain public trust"".  Ms Hillier, a Labour MP, said the failings uncovered may be the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The government overlooked a serious conflict of interest, paid consultants for months before giving them contracts and purchased masks it knew weren't up to scratch. ""It's bad enough that it set up a 'high-priority lane' to fast-track companies with the right connections. ""But the failure to track how half the companies had ended up on it made it impossible to ensure proper safeguards were in place."" The NAO looked in detail at 20 contracts including: The NAO concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". The spending watchdog acknowledged the pandemic required acting with ""extreme urgency"" and the Public Contracts Regulations allowed an emergency response, including awarding deals directly without a formal competition. Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic that has posed the biggest challenge to the UK in a generation. ""As this report rightly recognises, we needed to procure contracts with extreme urgency to secure the vital supplies required to protect frontline NHS workers and the public and we make no apology for that. ""We have robust processes in place for spending public money to ensure we get critical equipment to where it needs to go as quickly as possible, whilst also ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. ""It is important to maintain the public's confidence in how we manage their money, and we welcome the NAO's scrutiny of our processes and recommendations on how they can be improved.""",2020-11-18T00:15:51,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54978460,2020-11-18 08:16:53.939616,BBC,politics,0
Barack Obama: One election won't stop US 'truth decay',"The US faces a huge task in reversing a culture of ""crazy conspiracy theories"" that have exacerbated divides in the country, Barack Obama says. In a BBC interview, the former president says the US is more sharply split than even four years ago, when Donald Trump won the presidency. And Mr Obama suggests Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 US election is just the start of repairing those divisions. ""It'll take more than one election to reverse those trends,"" he says. Tackling a polarised nation, he argues, cannot be left only to the decisions of politicians, but also requires both structural change and people listening to one another - agreeing on a ""common set of facts"" before arguing what to do about them. However he says he sees ""great hope"" in the ""sophisticated"" attitudes of the next generation, urging young people to ""cultivate that cautious optimism that the world can change"" and ""to be a part of that change"". Anger and resentment between rural and urban America, immigration, injustices like inequality and ""the kinds of crazy conspiracy theories - what some have called truth decay"" have been amplified by some US media outlets and ""turbocharged by social media"", Mr Obama tells historian David Olusoga, in an interview for BBC Arts to promote his new memoir. ""We are very divided right now, certainly more than we were when I first ran for office in 2007 and won the presidency in 2008,"" the former president says. He suggests that this is, in part, attributable to Mr Trump's willingness to ""fan division because it was good for his politics"".  Something else that has contributed hugely to the issue, Mr Obama says, is the spread of misinformation online, where ""facts don't matter"".  ""There are millions of people who subscribed to the notion that Joe Biden is a socialist, who subscribed to the notion that Hillary Clinton was part of an evil cabal that was involved in paedophile rings,"" he says.   The example he uses here with Ms Clinton relates to a fake theory alleging that Democratic politicians were running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. ""I think at some point it's going to require a combination of regulation and standards within industries to get us back to the point where we at least recognise a common set of facts before we start arguing about what we should do about those facts."" Mr Obama says that while many conventional mainstream media outlets have embraced fact-checking in recent years in an effort to tackle the spread of misinformation online, it is often not enough because ""falsehoods had already circled the globe by the time truth got out of the gates"". He says division is also a result of socioeconomic factors such as increasing inequality and disparities between rural and urban America.  Such issues, he adds, are ""paralleled in the UK and around the world"" with ""people feeling as if they're losing a grip on the ladder of economic advancement and so react and can be persuaded that it's this group's fault or that group's fault"". By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation reporter  Viral conspiracy theories have been a staple feature of this year's US election - and a more mainstream school of thought during the Trump presidency. That's because online disinformation with conspiratorial undertones is no longer limited to the dark corners of the internet. It's promoted by prominent figures, with huge followings - like those in charge across the world, including in the White House.  The polarised world of the internet - where everything is a matter of opinion rather than fact, and we choose our tribe - has created a fertile breeding ground for conspiracies and misinformation. An increasing number of people who use social media to do their own research come to misleading conclusions - these can be exacerbated by one-sided coverage of stories by partisan media. As Barack Obama points out, these falsehoods or misleading claims - especially when amplified by the media or public figures - prove to be much more popular than any debunk. The solution may not reside in just presenting the facts - as important as that remains. It's also about understanding why people turn to conspiracies online and how they were exposed to them repeatedly.  I frequently speak to victims of online conspiracy theories about the damage they bring, and the divisions they cause. That has revealed how difficult and complex this damage is to undo.  Mr Obama, who made history as America's first black president, says the issue of race has been ""one of the central fault lines in American history - our original sin"". The events that unfolded over the summer, including the death of George Floyd - a black man who died in police custody - and the response to his death from communities not just in the US but around the world, created moments of both despair and optimism, he says.  ""Despair that the chronic lingering role of race and bias in our criminal justice system continues in such a blatant form... enormous optimism that you saw an outpouring of protest activism and interest that far exceeded anything we had seen previously - and was peaceful."" It was important that the protests were multi-racial, he says, adding that the response was different to that of the killing in 2012 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager who was shot dead by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman was later cleared of the 17-year-old's murder in a high-profile criminal case. Mr Obama also mentions the fatal shooting in 2014 of 18-year-old unarmed black man Michael Brown, who was shot six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. He says that while those incidents inflamed passions across America, stirring up debate over race and justice, there still appeared to be ""resistance among large portions of the white community to push back against the notion that this was more than just one incident or a case of bad apples"".  ""What you saw this summer was some communities that had a very negligible black population, folks going out there and saying Black Lives Matter and embracing the notion that real change has to come."" Mr Obama was speaking ahead of the release of his new memoir, A Promised Land, which charts his rise to the US Senate and first term as president. Due for release on 17 November, it is the first of two books covering his time in the White House. You can see the full interview in a special programme, Barack Obama talks to David Olusoga, this Wednesday on BBC One in the UK at 1930 GMT or internationally from Saturday 21 November on BBC World News.",2020-11-15T20:00:05,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54910344,2020-11-16 08:06:41.667159,BBC,politics,0
Covid: Boris Johnson to do Prime Minister's Questions via video,"Boris Johnson will become the first prime minister in history to conduct his weekly question-and-answer session with MPs via video link later, as he continues to self-isolate. He is working from 10 Downing Street after coming into contact with fellow Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who later tested positive for coronavirus. The PM decided to take questions rather than have deputy Dominic Raab fill in. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will be in the Commons chamber as usual. Up to 50 MPs are currently allowed in at any one time, with remote contributors using Zoom to ask questions and respond to ministerial statements. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""There is an agreement that Prime Minister's Questions will go ahead and the prime minister will take part remotely."" Meanwhile, the FDA senior civil servants' union has argued that Mr Johnson's use of a video link to answer questions shows a fully ""hybrid"" Parliament - using video conferencing across all parliamentary business - is possible. National officer Jawad Raza told the BBC it was ""unconscionable that an exception be made to suit the prime minister but not to protect the health and safety of everyone working across the Parliamentary Estate"". ""This doesn't just mean MPs, as hundreds of House staff work on the estate to support the work of parliamentarians and facilitate the UK's democratic processes,"" he added. Self-isolation means staying at home and not leaving it - even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS Covid-19 app, you must self-isolate for 14 days from the day you were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus. And if you develop symptoms during the 14-day period, you should get a test as soon as possible.  If the result is negative, you should continue isolating for the rest of the 14 days.  If positive, you should self-isolate for at least another 10 days from when your symptoms started. On Monday, House of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg gave way to an appeal from Conservative MP Tracey Crouch - who is receiving treatment for cancer - for more video participation for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. A motion aimed at making this happen will be debated on Wednesday. But Mr Rees-Mogg said he was resistant to widening the concession, insisting other MPs must ""behave as other key workers do"".  Mr Johnson's virtual participation comes despite a negative test for coronavirus, but his spokesman said he would self-isolate ""in accordance with the rules"". The prime minister - who was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 in April - is working from an office in No 10 that he can reach from his flat in No 11 without coming into contact with Downing Street staff.  A government spokesperson said the public was ""best served when Parliament meets physically to the fullest extent possible"". ""The [House of Commons] Speaker has worked hard with the House authorities to create a safe Covid-secure workplace for all who need to attend so that, just as teaching and medical professions are working in person to keep the country moving, so are MPs and peers,"" they added.",2020-11-18T00:57:53,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54982059,2020-11-18 08:18:32.043385,BBC,politics,0
US election: Trump appears to admit Biden victory in tweet,"Donald Trump has insisted he is not conceding the US election, despite seemingly acknowledging for the first time that Democrat Joe Biden had won. ""He won because the Election was Rigged,"" he wrote on Twitter but minutes later said he was not conceding that he lost the 3 November election. Mr Trump also repeated unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud.  He has launched a slew of lawsuits in key states but has not provided any evidence to back his claims of fraud. All the lawsuits have so far been unsuccessful. On Friday, election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"" and there was ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised"". Nevertheless, Mr Trump has refused to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory until - apparently - now. On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" In a news conference on the same day, Mr Trump said ""who knows"" which administration would be in power in the future. Despite acknowledging Mr Biden's victory in one tweet on Sunday, the president went on to say ""I concede NOTHING!"". Twitter added a warning to Mr Trump's latest allegations of wrongdoing, saying ""This claim of election fraud is disputed"".  Thousands of Mr Trump's supporters protested in Washington DC on Saturday to back his unsubstantiated claims.  Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests.  The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes.  Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured.  Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mr Trump to officially concede and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings.",2020-11-15T14:44:15,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54952098,2020-11-15 16:12:00.641910,BBC,world,0
Indian factory workers supplying major brands allege routine exploitation,"By Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News, Delhi Indian workers in factories supplying the supermarket chains Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury's, and the fashion brand Ralph Lauren, told the BBC they are being subjected to exploitative conditions. Women working at a Ralph Lauren supplier said they had been forced to stay overnight to complete orders, sometimes requiring them to sleep on the factory floor. ""We're made to work continuously, often through the night, sleeping at 3am then waking up by 5am for another full day,"" one woman said in an interview. ""Our bosses don't care. They're only bothered about production,"" she said. The BBC has withheld the names of those who agreed to be interviewed, as well as the names of the factories, to protect the workers' safety. Workers at the supermarket supplier said they had been made to endure conditions which would be unacceptable for staff employed by the same brands in the UK.  ""We don't get toilet breaks, we don't get time to drink water on shift. We barely get time to eat lunch,"" one woman said.  She said a manager would sometimes stand behind staff in the canteen and blow a whistle to send them back to work. Another employee said staff were forced to work overtime and prevented from going home until extra work was finished. ""They've increased our workload. We're forced to stay late to finish it - or they yell at us and threaten to fire us. We're scared as we don't want to lose our jobs."" The four brands supplied by the factories we investigated all said they were concerned about the allegations put to them by the BBC and would investigate. The women working at these garment factories all live in poverty in a rural area of South India. The charity Action Aid, which supports more than 1,200 female garment workers across 45 villages in this specific region, told the BBC that forced overtime, verbal abuse and poor working conditions were routine at the factories in question.  Allegations such as these are not confined to the garment industry. Low wages and weak labour laws have long made India an attractive place for foreign brands looking to outsource work. Unions are rare and virtually absent in the private sector, making informal and contract workers especially vulnerable. While inspections are mandatory, rampant corruption and a sluggish system has meant that factories are rarely held to account for breaking the law.  The garment industry draws more attention because it's driven by exports and counts some of the world's biggest brands as among its clients. India is the world's second-largest manufacturer and exporter of garments after China. India's garment makers directly employ about 12.9 million people in factories and millions more outside, including their own homes, according to a 2019 report that investigated working conditions in the sector. Several women who spoke to the BBC described a climate of fear at the factory supplying Ralph Lauren. They said managers did not give them notice to work additional hours, instead threatening them with the sack if they were unable to stay on.  ""The supervisor always shouts at us,"" one woman said. ""If we make any error in stitching, I'll be taken to the master who is very scary. The master will start swearing and shouting at us. It's a terrifying experience"" Another woman, a widow who supports her family financially, said: ""They ask us to work so late I can't even feed my children at night. They shouldn't treat us like slaves, they should give us respect,"" she said. The claims appear to violate India's Factories Act, which states that no worker should exceed more than 48 hours a week (or 60 hours with overtime), nor should they be made to work for more than nine hours in one day.   The law also states that women should only work night shifts if they choose to do so. Ralph Lauren's 2020 Global Citizenship and sustainability report says the company is ""committed to conducting our global operations ethically with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products"". The report also includes a pledge to ensure employees ""must not be made to work excessive working hours"" and says there should be no ""verbal harassment, coercion, punishment or abuse"". The three brands are all members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), and have signed up to its base code which includes a pledge to ensure working hours are not excessive, overtime is voluntary and that workers are not subject to verbal abuse. In a statement, Ralph Lauren said it was deeply concerned by the allegations put to the company by the BBC and would investigate.  ""We require all of our suppliers to meet strict operating standards to ensure a safe, healthy and ethical workplace, and we conduct regular third-party audits at all factories,"" the company said. The factory supplying the fashion brand denied the staff members' allegations and said it was compliant with the law.  The three supermarket brands all said they were shocked to hear the reports and were working together to ensure the issues were remedied, in particular on excessive working hours.  Sainsbury's said it was ""insisting on a number of actions the supplier must take in order for us to continue to work with them"", including ""immediate actions and ongoing commitments the supplier must make while we continue to closely monitor the site"". Tesco said: ""We don't tolerate any abuse of workers' rights and fully investigated these allegations as soon as we were made aware. We were deeply troubled with what we found.""  Tesco said its plan included ""prohibiting excessive overtime, strengthening grievance procedures"" and ensuring workers were ""fully compensated at the correct rates for hours they've worked"". Marks & Spencer said it ""undertook an immediate unannounced audit"" in the wake of the claims, the company said it ""identified overtime working practices that are not acceptable"", but disputed worker accounts about access to toilet breaks and water.  The company also said it had a ""robust"" plan in place and would be ""undertaking regular unannounced audits to ensure its implementation"".  These kinds of brands do not own or operate factories in India, which creates distance between them and working conditions there, but one owner of a clothing supplier - who did not want to be named - told the BBC that if brands push for cheaper clothes it can leave suppliers with no choice but to cut corners to meet orders. ""It's the brand who wants to maximize the profit. So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive,"" he said. The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a ""sham"".  ""The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before,"" he said. ""The moment the audit is over, everything goes back to normal, which means exploitation and non compliance."" He said that poor checks and balances, combined with a lack of responsibility by the brands, makes it hard to stamp out that exploitation.  ""It is the way of working in the textile industry, it's just not India, it's everywhere."" And as profits are squeezed, women often find themselves losing out. Payslips seen by the BBC show women working in garment factories can earn as little as Â£2.50 per day, making items which, in some cases, sell for hundreds of pounds. More than 40% of workers surveyed by Action Aid India reported that their average monthly income was in the range of Rs. 2000-5000. (Â£20-Â£50). ""Women are undervalued and underpaid throughout global supply chains,"" said Ether Mariaselvam, the regional manager at Action Aid's Chennai office. All of the workers who spoke to the BBC described living in impoverished conditions and said they struggled to survive on their salaries. One woman working at the Ralph Lauren supplier said she supported her entire family on a wage of around 6,000 rs (Â£61 per month), after deductions. Still in her late teens, she became the breadwinner after her father died and now provides for her mother and two sisters. Her salary is within the local legal minimum wage bracket for her job, but labour rights organisations say women like her should be earning more than three times as much.  The Asia Floor Wage Alliance organisation which advocates for higher salaries for garment workers in the region, has set a monthly living wage in India of at least 18,727 rs (Â£190). Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have previously made commitments to a living wage. Ralph Lauren has not done so explicitly.   But according to payslips seen by the BBC, neither of the factories we investigated appeared to be paying their workers anything close to the Asia Floor Wage Alliance recommended minimum amount. We asked all four brands to comment on the living wage but none of them responded on the specific issue. Anna Bryher, from the advocacy group Labour behind the Label, said it was the responsibility of brands to ensure fair and safe working conditions. ""If you're a brand and you're making clothing in different countries around the world then you need to look at  whether you're paying your workers enough to live with dignity,"" she said. ""It's your responsibility as the company at the top of the supply chain to know what is happening in your supply chain and to make sure that it's fair.""  Local labour laws were not doing enough to address exploitation, the push for change needs to come from the brands themselves,"" argues Vivek Soundararajan, a senior lecturer at Bath University who researches global supply chains. ""Most checks and balances do not include workers voices, they do not include what workers actually need,"" he said.  ""I think the brand should take the full responsibility â¦ They may not run the factory, but they get all the benefits."" Photographs by Rextane Nissi S.

Covid: Nine ways England's lockdown is different from last time,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News England is back in lockdown, with pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops closed. Here are nine things that are different from the March lockdown.  In March, you could only meet others from outside your household in a very limited set of circumstances. Meeting another person socially wasn't allowed until May. This time, you can catch up with a friend in an outdoor public place, like a park or beach, as long as you socially distance and neither of you is self-isolating. And this time, children of pre-school age are not included in the two-person limit, so those looking after youngsters can still have social contact. The government has emphasised that it is prioritising education - so schools, colleges and universities will all remain open, as will nurseries and other childcare. They closed back in March and while studies continued online, many students did not return in person until September. In the summer, scientists had warned that pubs and other activities might have to close for schools to remain open in the second wave. ''We cannot let this virus damage our children's futures even more than it has already,'' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, adding that clinical advice is for young people to be in school. The government has specifically said that public toilets can remain open. This also applies at visitor attractions like gardens and castles, if they are normally available to the public and are sufficiently separate. During the last lockdown, many councils did not reopen their public toilets when allowed.  People with young children and long-term health conditions were particularly affected, and with pubs and restaurants closed, many complained they were forced to relieve themselves in public places. Many people are going into this lockdown as part of a support ""bubble"", a concept which didn't exist back in March. It means that an adult living alone or a single parent family can mix freely with one other nominated household of any size.  A household with children under 13 can also form a childcare bubble with another household to help with informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare. This must always be between the same two households.However, the Cabinet Office has been unable to confirm to the BBC whether one or more people from the second household can provide the childcare - so in the case of grandparents, for example, whether only one of them can do it. Bubbles will continue during the lockdown. Non-essential shops are closing once again, but this time click and collect - where customers order products online and go to pick them up - will be allowed. Click and collect involves minimal contact, and could help shops to keep more workers employed. Garden centres can also stay open this time, as can waste and recycling tips. In the early days of lockdown, sitting on a bench could be interpreted as breaking coronavirus rules - unless the person was taking a break from exercising. Sunbathing or reading outdoors were also not permitted. This time, the government has not placed any time limit on recreational activities, with the prime minister suggesting that meeting a friend in the park for a walk or sitting on a bench and eating a sandwich was perfectly fine. The message is very different now to March, when people were told to take only one form of exercise outdoors a day.  The government is mindful of obesity, mental health and other problems caused by lockdown inactivity, and the risks of coronavirus transmission are generally higher indoors. The new lockdown guidance says ""you can and should still travel to... spend time or exercise outdoors. This should be done locally wherever possible, but you can travel to do so if necessary"". Only essential travel was permitted in the spring, but this was open to interpretation, with one police force criticised for sharing drone footage of ramblers online. Dentists and opticians were only open for emergency appointments at the start of the last lockdown. But they can open as usual this time, as can chiropractors and osteopaths. Boots Opticians and Specsavers say they will operate as normal, while the British Dental Association has confirmed that dental services will be available. An alarming side-effect of the last lockdown was missed medical appointments, as many worried about burdening the health service or being exposed to the virus. This has potentially led to thousands of missed diagnoses and treatments. Mr Johnson stressed it is ''really important''  to ''get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments'', during this lockdown and all winter. About two million vulnerable people had to shield in the last lockdown, meaning they stayed at home. Many found this advice ''very restrictive,'' the government says.  The aim is to strike a balance between practical measures to keep people safe, while reducing the harm caused to their wellbeing and mental health. ""I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way,"" Mr Johnson said. However, the ""clinically extremely vulnerable"", including organ transplant patients and people with certain cancers, have been told to take extra care to minimise contact with others, including working from home. They have been advised not to go to shops, but can still exercise and go to school.",2020-11-04T13:50:42,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-54793959,2020-11-13 14:39:41.864040,BBC,travel,0
Newspaper headlines: 'No 10 reset in disarray' as PM self-isolates,"By BBC NewsStaff ""Bo no!"" is the reaction from the Sun Online to the prime minister having to self-isolate after meeting an MP who later tested positive.  Metro reports Boris Johnson will have to stay in his Downing Street flat until 26 November. The Daily Telegraph says Mr Johnson's isolation will raise ""fresh questions"" about the mandatory policy given he has already recovered from the virus and there are very few cases of people getting it twice.  The paper also points out Downing Street's safety measures are likely to come ""under scrutiny"" as it claims to be a Covid-secure workplace.  The Guardian says the PM will continue to make public statements from his flat as he seeks to ""restore calm to his rattled government... and project an air of competence"" following the ""vicious"" turf war in No 10. But the paper says it not yet clear whether he will participate in Prime Minister's Questions via video link. The i paper describes the situation as a ""challenge"" for Boris Johnson, as he had hoped to embark on a ""charm offensive"" to rebuild relations with MPs.  With his senior aides now gone, the Financial Times reveals Boris Johnson has told Conservative Party donors that the government is entering a ""new phase"" that will be ""less combative"".  Allies of the prime minister say this will include policies to preserve the UK and proposals for ""collaborative relations"" with Scotland - an issue Dominic Cummings is said not to have cared about.  Mr Cummings' departure is also reportedly set to trigger changes to the cabinet, with one minister telling the FT ex-chancellor Sajid Javid is now a ""dead cert"" to return. The Times reports Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering plans to charge motorists for using Britain's roads amid concerns a switch to electric vehicles could create a Â£40bn tax shortfall. Fuel duty is estimated to raise Â£27.5bn this financial year - the equivalent of 1.3% of national income.  While a government source has said a national road pricing scheme is not ""imminent"", the chancellor is said to be ""very interested"" in it to offset the potential loss of one of the government's biggest revenue earners.  ""Scotland days away from new lockdown,"" is the headline on the front of the Scottish Daily Mail. It says government officials have told business leaders to expect level four restrictions - which includes the closure of non-essential retail - to be confirmed for much of west central Scotland following a review tomorrow. They have indicated the measures will last for two weeks and come into force from Friday. Twelve local authority areas are set to be affected including Glasgow, Inverclyde and Stirling. Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox With the end of the Brexit transition period drawing closer, there is a renewed focus on whether the government will agree a trade deal with the EU.   The Daily Mirror says Boris Johnson remains ""firm in refusing to budge"" to secure an agreement, while Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove are said to back a deal.  The FT's editorial says it's important the government reaches an agreement because the UK cannot afford a ""chaotic"" end to the transition period.  The Daily Express urges No 10 not to ""blink first"" in negotiations, while the Sun agrees, calling the EU's demands ""patently absurd"" to anyone but ""Tory-hating, Remainer diehards on Twitter"".  And finally, images of Des O'Connor feature on many front pages following his death aged 88.  The Times' obituary describes him as ""congenial and cheerful"" but someone whose style was ""middle-of-the-road naffness"". The Guardian says that, despite spending ""three decades as the punchline of cruel jokes"" from Eric Morecambe, he had the ""last laugh"" by sustaining a peak-time TV career only rivalled by Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir David Attenborough.  The Daily Telegraph points out that while his ""enduring appeal baffled the more highbrow critics"", the secret of his success was that his interview style allowed celebrities to wear whatever self-image they had chosen and plug their merchandise ""without fear of snide asides or interruption"".",2020-11-16T05:59:02,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-54954833,2020-11-16 08:08:23.501390,BBC,politics,0
Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: 'My little brother needs medicine',"By Hana ZeratsyonBBC Tigrinya With my 11-year-old brother suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication following the outbreak of a new conflict in Ethiopia's already war-scarred Tigray region. He lives in the regional capital, Mekelle, with my parents and siblings and - just days before the conflict started - I had what has turned out to be my last video chat with them about his treatment.  As his medication is expensive and pharmacies in Mekelle often run out of stock, I agreed to send money to my family to pay for the drugs, while they were going to get the medication from the federal capital, Addis Ababa. I did a bank transfer from Kenya's capital Nairobi - where I live - to Mekelle, but with the state-owned National Bank of Ethiopia now shutting all of its more than 600 branches in Tigray because of the conflict, my family cannot withdraw the money.  And even if they get the cash, they cannot get the medicines, as all passenger flights into Tigray have been halted, meaning that no-one can bring it from Addis Ababa. Road travel between the two cites, about 700km (435 miles) away from each other, has also stopped, leaving many Tigrayans stranded in the federal capital. The airspace is now restricted to military aircraft.  Ethiopia's Prime Minster and Nobel Peace laureate Abiy Ahmed has warned people in Tigray to avoid holding gatherings as he has ordered air strikes to destroy the military arsenal of the regional government. He wants to dislodge it from power after accusing it of being illegally in office and of violently taking control of a federal military base near Mekelle, charges the Tigray government denies. The regional government has also heavily restricted road travel within Tigray, as fighting takes place, according to the UN, in eight locations, including in the sesame-growing area of Humera, where farmers are usually harvesting crops at this time of the year, helped by workers from the neighbouring region of Amhara, in a sign of how the fate of Ethiopians of all ethnic groups is intertwined.  Now, fear and suspicion are growing, with some Tigrayans in the federal police and military telling me that they have been ordered by their superiors to hand in their weapons, and to stop reporting for work. When news of the conflict broke in the early hours of 4 November - the day the world's attention was focused on the fiercely contested US election - I received a message from a colleague, saying: ""Have you heard what's happened? Have you checked on your family?"" I immediately dialled the numbers of my parents and siblings, but could not get through to any of them as the phone lines were down and the internet was shut, cutting me - and hundreds of thousands of others - off from our families in Tigray.  I miss my little brother the most. As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video link-ups of my family.  Now, I cling to the photos I have of him - and hope that the conflict ends soon so that he can get his medication. I had also been thinking of getting him over to Nairobi for further medical check-ups. I was also thinking of buying him a wheelchair as he has difficulty walking.  All this will have to wait until the conflict ends, but what if it drags on? This is a real possibility as the prime minister has rejected mediation while the regional government - led by a former guerrilla movement, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - is unlikely to give up power without a fight to the finish.  What will then happen to my family and other families? Will there be a scarcity of food? Will prices rise? How will families cope with a shortage of cash, especially if they rely on remittances sent by relatives living abroad?  There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel in Tigray - and, worst of all, water which was already rationed.  In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected, they can no longer call to put in orders.  On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity. But my biggest worry is this: What if tanks roll into my home town or if it is hit in an air strike? I have vivid childhood memories of the 1998-2000 border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea - of being shielded by my mother in our home as we heard the terrifying roar of fighter jets and of being told never to wear white clothes to avoid being spotted.  This aversion lasted until my teens, when I finally said to myself: ""It really is OK to wear white.""  Some of my friends - whose minds are also racing back to that era, a time which we thought we had left behind - are having worse flashbacks - of building bunkers in their school as four-year-olds; of an Eritrean air strike killing children at another school; of friends and neighbours never returning from the frontline.  One friend's memory goes back even further - to the stories he had heard about how his mother fled  to the outskirts of Mekelle in 1989 to escape air bombardments ordered by Ethiopia's then-ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime, and to how his grandfather survived the 1943 bombing of the city by the British Royal Air Force at the request of Emperor Haile Selassie.  So, the people of Mekelle - like those in other parts of Tigray and Ethiopia - have lived through war after war.  They are worried about another one, especially when the festive season is approaching.  I had planned to go back to celebrate Christmas in January - as Ethiopian Orthodox Christians do - and to get married to my boyfriend, who continued to live in Mekelle after I moved to Nairobi a few years ago to work for the BBC.  But my plans are frozen, as I find myself cut off from him and my family. It reminds me of my father, a humble carpenter, who lost all contact with his sister in Eritrea because of the war that the two countries fought. For two decades, he spoke of how much he missed her. When border crossings reopened - albeit temporarily - following the peace deal Mr Abiy negotiated with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki in 2018, he was looking forward to seeing her, only to learn that she had died. For his peace efforts with Eritrea, Mr Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 and, in his acceptance speech in Oslo, said:  ""It takes a few to make war. But it takes a village and a nation to build peace. For me nurturing peace is like planting and growing trees. Just like trees need water and good soil to grow, peace requires unwavering commitment, infinite patience and goodwill to cultivate and harvest its dividends."" Like many others, I am hoping that Mr Abiy and Tigray's leader Debretsion Gebremichae now make peace.  Otherwise, the seeds of hatred could grow, in a nation already hit by ethnic clashes that have left about two million people - including more than 100,000 Tigrayans - homeless in different parts of Ethiopia since 2018.

'I can't let go of my remaining embryos',"Ashley Strong has three children conceived through IVF. She knows she doesn't want any more, but she is still paying each year for three embryos to be frozen in storage at an IVF clinic. ""I keep paying to not make the decision,"" she told 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Every year the clinic writes to her asking what she wants to do, but she still can't bear to let them go. ""The letter comes on an annual basis,"" Ashley says. ""I fight quite hard not to open it or look at it for as long as possible to try and give myself some time to think about it. ""They've been in storage now for eight years and I'm still no closer to reaching a decision."" Some people who are having fertility treatment have leftover embryos after their IVF cycle.  Instead of discarding them, there is the option to freeze them to use in the future, in case the treatment doesn't work or to try for a sibling at a later date. Under the current guidelines, people can have their embryos stored for up to 10 years. After that time, they have to decide what happens to them - either use them, donate them or, as the terminology describes it, ""leave them to perish"". According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), storage costs can range from around Â£125 to Â£350 a year. ""Knowing that the 10-year limit comes to an end and somebody else makes the decision for me was something I was banking on,"" Ashley says.  ""But then I got a letter a couple of weeks ago saying, because of Covid, they will extend it for a further two years. I thought, 'that just means I'm going to have to pay for an extra two years'.  ""Really, I should perhaps make a decision and get on with it but I just find it incredibly hard and I don't think I can make a decision without counselling. ""All the options to me are not palatable as options at the moment and that's what I'm struggling with."" Part of the reason the choice is so painful for Ashley is that it is tied up with the difficulties she faced having children. ""We've been through so many miscarriages, so many disappointments, so to just discard them like that is really difficult for me to do."" She says her husband was not as emotional about the process and would be ""perfectly happy for them to be donated"". But for her there is an emotional attachment that is preventing her from making a decision. Figures from the HFEA show that, in 2018, 164 embryos were donated for reproduction, and 721 were donated to science. The authority does not hold the data for how many embryos perished after the 10-year storage limit. But it acknowledged ""letting go of remaining embryos can be a difficult decision"". Natalie Silverman and her husband have a five-year-old son who was conceived via NHS-funded IVF.  Their treatment entitled them to one year's storage, but after that they had to fund the storage costs themselves. Slowly they came to the realisation that they could not afford another child, or to keep paying for storage. Natalie, who hosts a podcast about fertility, received counselling on and off for 18 months to help her come to terms with the process. ""I found it the most difficult decision because you're putting a definite end on something. You're saying: 'I'm not having any more children,'"" she says. Deciding what to do with their embryos was a big decision too. Natalie said donating to a couple was not an option for her because she could not imagine there being ""another replica of my son"". Instead, Natalie and her husband chose to donate the three embryos to science and she says the gratitude they received made them happier about their decision. ""Embryologists see what you do when you donate as the most precious thing. They refer to it as a gift and they talk about the embryos as being such precious material,"" she says.  ""It kind of made me feel like this was something I could get my head around."" The couple donated their embryos in February - a lengthy process that involved a lot of paperwork. But afterwards they held a ceremony to say goodbye to the children they would never have. ""We went to the beach and we threw three roses into the sea to mark our three embryos and it was really lovely,"" Natalie says.  ""It was lovely that they then obviously came back in with the tide and, as we walked off, I watched another lady stop and take a little picture which felt quite poignant. ""I think marking of these things is really important as a closure point,"" she added. You can listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds. It starts about 45 minutes into the programme. The HFEA has produced an information booklet on what options are available for donating or discarding remaining embryos. Some fertility clinics offer extra support or counselling. Alternatively, GPs can give advice about getting counselling on the NHS. For private therapy, the British Infertility Counselling Association (BICA) has a directory of accredited therapists with various options including telephone and Skype counselling. Support is also available from Fertility Network UK.",2020-11-18T01:03:41,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/54890580,2020-11-18 08:23:09.353124,BBC,politics,0
Social media: How can we protect its youngest users?,"By Talia FrancoBBC Click Children searching for content relating to depression and self-harm can be exposed to more of it by the recommendation engines built in to social networks.  Sophie Parkinson was just 13 when she took her own life. She had depression and suicidal thoughts.  Her mother, Ruth Moss, believes Sophie eventually took her own life because of the videos she had watched online.  Like many youngsters, Sophie was given a phone when she was 12.  Ruth recalls discovering soon after that Sophie had been using it to view inappropriate material online. ""The really hard bit for the family after Sophie's death was finding some really difficult imagery and guides to how she could take her own life,"" she says. Almost 90% of 12 to 15-year-olds have a mobile phone, according to the communications watchdog Ofcom. And it estimates that three-quarters of those have a social media account.  The most popular apps restrict access to under-13s but many younger children sign up and the platforms do little to stop them.  The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) thinks the tech firms should be forced by law to think about the risks children face on their products. ""For over a decade, the children's safety has not been considered as part of the core business models by the big tech firms,"" says Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the charity. ""The designs of the sites can push vulnerable young teenagers, who are looking at suicide or self-harm, to watch more of that type of content."" Recently, a video of a young man taking his own life was posted on Facebook. The footage subsequently spread to other platforms, including TikTok, where it stayed online for days.  TikTok has acknowledged users would be better protected if social media providers worked more closely together.  But Ruth echoes the NSPCC's view and thinks social networks should not be allowed to police themselves.  She says some of the material her daughter accessed six years ago is still online, and typing certain words into Facebook or Instagram brings up the same imagery.   Facebook announced the expansion of an automated tool to recognise and remove self-harm and suicide content from Instagram  earlier this week, but has said data privacy laws in Europe limit what it can do. Other smaller start-ups are also trying to use technology to address the issue. SafeToWatch is developing software that is trained by machine-learning techniques to block inappropriate scenes including violence and nudity in real-time. It analyses the context of any visual material and monitors the audio. It suggest this provides a balanced way for parents to protect their children without intruding too deeply into their privacy. ""We never let parents see what the kid is doing, as we need to earn the trust of the child which is crucial to the cyber-safety process,"" explains founder Richard Pursey. Ruth suggests it's often easy to blame parents, adding that safety tech only helps in limited circumstances as children become more independent.  ""Most parents can't know what exactly goes on their teenager's mobile phone and monitor what they have seen,"" she says. And many experts agree that it is inevitable most children will encounter inappropriate content at some point, so they need to gain ""digital resilience"". ""Safety online should be taught in the same way as other skills that keep us safe in the physical world,"" explains Dr Linda Papadopoulos, a psychologist working with the Internet Matters safety non-profit. ""Parents should have frank conversations about the types of content kids might encounter online and teach them ways to protect themselves."" She says the average age children are exposed to pornography is 11. When this happens, she advises, parents should try to discuss the issues involved rather than confiscating the device used to view it. ""Take a pause before you react,"" she suggests.

Des O'Connor: From Butlin's to chat show king,"Des O'Connor once said that all he did was walk on to the stage, chat to the audience and sing a few songs. It was a formula that made him one of Britain's best-known stars, an old-fashioned showman who could turn his hand to almost anything - fronting his variety programme, hosting chat shows or presiding over the quiz Countdown. An almost ever-present face on UK television, he held the record for more mainstream appearances on the small screen than any other performer. O'Connor, who has died aged 88 after a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire, also carved out a successful career as a singer including four Top 10 hits and more than 30 albums. Desmond Bernard O'Connor was born on 12 January 1932 in Stepney, East London, the son of a Jewish cleaner and an Irish dustman. He contracted rickets while he was a child which resulted in him having callipers on his legs until he was seven. He was also badly injured in a car accident and spent some time in an iron lung which disrupted his primary school education. During the war, the family moved to Northampton where he signed as a schoolboy player with Northampton Football Club although he only made the third team. It was while working in a local shoe factory that he discovered a talent for making people laugh, once recalling his ability to reduce the firm's typing school to giggles  and to be the main source of entertainment on works outings. His prowess as a performer came to the fore during his national service with the RAF, when his commanding officer insisted he take part in a talent show.  After he was demobbed, he secured a job as Red Coat with Butlin's - a role that provided the springboard for many a famous show business name -  before he was signed up to appear in a variety show at Newcastle's Palace Theatre in 1953.  His early success was gained by his astonishing ability to generate an instant rapport with his audiences, something that would carry him though the ensuing decades of his career. ""If you are not enjoying it,"" he once said, ""how do you expect them to."" When rock 'n' roll arrived, the variety theatres saw the potential of booking big name music stars and building a show around them. In this way O'Connor found himself as the compere when Buddy Holly toured the UK in 1958.  ""After all, I was given the princely sum of a hundred pounds per week which was a lot of money back in those days."" O'Connor's fame as a performer soared when he was recruited by ITV to host The Des O'Connor Show, which ran from 1963 to 1971. The show followed the format of theatre variety with O'Connor wisecracking to the audience, singing songs and introducing a stream of guest stars.  When the show was first filmed in colour in 1970, ATV did a deal for it to be shown on network television in the US bringing O'Connor to a whole new audience. It led to live appearances in Las Vegas. By the end of the 1960s, he was one of Britain's best-known stars and was chosen as the first victim when This Is Your Life was resurrected by Thames Television in 1969. Fittingly he was surprised on stage at the London Palladium, a venue where he performed more than 1,000 times.  In 1977, O' Connor began hosting Des O'Connor Tonight, a variety chat show. It began on BBC Two where it ran for five years before switching to ITV, eventually ending in 2002 after nearly 26 years on air. It was notable for showcasing the work of comedians. Ken Dodd and Benny Hill were among the established comics who appeared and new talent, such as the Cornish comedian, Jethro, got their big breaks on the show. It was broadcast live, something that occasionally provided some controversial moments. There was an appearance by an obviously intoxicated Oliver Reed while, on another occasion, Liverpool comedian Stan Boardman told his risque  joke about Fokkers which saw him banned from ITV. ""I just looked at the ceiling,"" O'Connor later recalled, ""then I held my head in my hands. The audience roared with laughter."" O'Connor was a regular guest on the Morecambe and Wise Show usually the butt of jokes about his ability as a singer. Eric would come out with lines such as, ""If you want me to be a goner, buy me a record by Des O'Connor,"" often with the singer standing behind him.  In fact, O'Connor had four Top 10 singles, including, I Pretend, which went to No 1 in 1968 and recorded more than 30 albums, six of which were Top 40 entries.  What the audience didn't realise was that many of the gags were written by O'Connor himself, who had been great friends with the duo since their early days in show business. Having cut his teeth as a game show host on Take Your Pick in 1992, O' Connor had a year as co-host of the show, Countdown, with Carol Vorderman. He was awarded a CBE in 2008. Away from the stage, he was a keen racegoer as befitted a man who once held an amateur jockey licence and, for a time, owned a number of racehorses.  O'Connor was married four times, describing the end of his first three relationships as casualties of his obsession with work. In 2007, he married long-term girlfriend Jodie Brooke Wilson, 37 years his junior who had given birth to his son Adam when O'Connor was in his 70s. Des O'Connor was the consummate professional, a natural performer who never lost his love of just standing in front of an audience and giving them some good old entertainment.  ""If it ever became work, I'd pack it up,"" O'Connor once said. ""I've never done a day's work in my life.""",2020-11-15T09:37:35,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39733917,2020-11-15 16:18:31.160571,BBC,entertainment,1
"Covid: How to survive a winter lockdown, from those who've done it","By Alice EvansBBC News As the dark nights draw in ever earlier and ever colder, the prospect of winter lockdowns across the UK are filling many of us with dread. But millions of people across the world have already experienced coronavirus lockdowns often in sub-zero temperatures - so what can we learn from them? Lockdown in TromsÃ¸ began in March 2020, when the average temperature was -1.1C, with lows of -8.9C. It rained or snowed almost every day. Ida Solhaug says coping with a winter lockdown is all about mindset. The mindfulness researcher at the University of TromsÃ¸ says my line of questioning - about how to ""get through"" the cold months - is a big part of the problem. She says Brits often see winter as ""something to endure"" rather than ""really embracing winter for what it's worth"". She says adopting a ""positive winter mindset"" could help us cope with the stresses of a lockdown at this time of year. For example, instead of moaning about not being able to meet up in big groups, be grateful that we can wrap up warm and go on a winter walk with one person from another household, Ida says. Cycling to work in the snow or meeting friends outside (at -8C) with a flask of coffee were two ways Ida coped with ""the long Covid winter"" - but she says people in the UK can do far less extreme things to enjoy winter during lockdown. Ida's top tips: Melbourne entered a three-month lockdown during Australian winter in July, when temperatures reached lows of 3.1C, and highs of 17.4C. The luxury of a hot bath helped Rowan Bruce to face the mental pressures of a 112-day lockdown in Melbourne. Rowan found that running a bath, pouring a glass of wine and watching a film or TV programme - all at the same time - became one of the highlights of his week. He particularly enjoyed watching travel shows presented by the celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain: ""If I can't travel, I'll travel with him instead."" ""It's something I'd never really done before, and now it's my favourite thing to do every Saturday,"" says Rowan, 36, who works at a local brewery. ""It's got to the point where everyone knows that between 3:30pm and 4:30pm every Saturday, I'm probably in the tub."" He says the ritual provided structure to his day and became the perfect way to spend a cold afternoon in lockdown. Rowan's friend, Gillian Nix, agrees routine is important - such as dragging her young children out for a daily morning walk - but she says trying to think of fun activities to fill the time can lead to burnout. Gillian says she and her husband, Chris, were full of energy and ideas at the beginning of lockdown. They would organise ""country days"" with their children Alice, six, and Otis, three, where they cooked food, dressed up, and watched films from a different country each week. ""But now we're just really tired of being at home with the kids and thinking of things to do. It feels like pure fatigue,"" she says. In her lowest moments in lockdown, Gillian, 38, said it was important to be kind to herself. ""Allowing yourself to have a bad hour where you just put on kids' TV or YouTube or whatever, that's fine. This isn't your normal parenting style.  ""Before lockdown we would go on day trips, to the beach, or to art galleries, and go out, [but] you can't judge yourself on now because it's not the normal thing. So take it hour by hour."" Gillian and Rowan's top tips: Lockdown began in January in Wuhan, when the city saw lows of -3.6C and a top temperature of 14C. Yilang Zeng experienced the first city-wide lockdown of the pandemic after travelling to visit her parents in Wuhan for Chinese New Year in January. The Emirates airline cabin crew member, aged 27, relished the extended ""holiday"" with her parents, because she had been living in Dubai, since 2016.  While the two-month lockdown meant Yilang could really settle into family time, she also made a point of bringing her cabin crew etiquette home with her. ""Always compliment the one who cooks,"" she says, because otherwise, ""it might be the longest holiday together with your family"". Yilang says the cold and wet Wuhan weather made it tempting to leave the heating on all day - but she suggests putting on a jumper and throwing open a window, to get some fresh air inside. Yilang's top tips:  Toronto's average temperature in March, when people were first urged to stay at home due to Covid, was 4.0C, with lows of -7.7C. Snow lay on the ground most days.  ""I think it's important not to pressure yourself with the notion of going outside,"" says Ashwini Selvakumaran. When Canada's prime minister urged people to stay inside and the country went into lockdown, in March, the third-year student at the University of Toronto decided to move out of her flat in the city to stay with her parents in the nearby town of Milton. Ashwini's parents repeatedly encouraged her to go for runs in the bracing cold, but she shrank away from the cold air and snow. ""I love dancing and moving my body to music, and online there were so many videos and free Zumba tutorials and I just did those,"" the 20-year-old says.  ""Not only did it increase my ability to be active inside the house, but it also made me feel happy just being able to relate back to that passion that I love.""

Covid: What are the rules that mean Boris Johnson has to self-isolate?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Johnson says he was contacted by NHS Test and Trace on Sunday and will continue working from No 10. What are the rules around self-isolation and who has to do it? You should self-isolate if: Mr Johnson was told he needed to self-isolate after spending time with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who lost his sense of taste the next day. Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it. You should not go out for any reason -  even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. You should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to help out by getting what you need and leaving items outside your front door. If you have Covid-19 symptoms, however mild, you should self-isolate for at least 10 days from when they started, and arrange to get tested. If you have no symptoms, but have tested positive for the disease, you must also self-isolate for at least 10 days. This starts from the day you took the test. If you develop symptoms during this time, you must restart your 10-day isolation. If you still have a temperature after 10 days, you should continue to self-isolate, but can go out again if by then you only have a cough or loss of taste or smell. If you have coronavirus all other people in your household also need to self-isolate. They must not leave the house for 14 days from the day you first became ill, or - if you have no symptoms - from the day you had a test. If they then display symptoms, they must start a new 10-day isolation period from the day they first appear. If you are told by NHS Test and Trace that you were in contact with a person who tested positive, as in Mr Johnson's case, you must self-isolate for 14 days from the date you last met. Mr Johnson will have to remain at No 10 until 26 November. If you have symptoms or test positive, you need to try to keep apart from other members of your household. You should stay in a well-ventilated room where you can open a window, but keep the door closed. You should also use a separate bathroom. If this is not possible, then you should use the bathroom after everyone else and clean it thoroughly afterwards. Meals should be eaten in your room and not in a shared area like the kitchen. Anyone entering England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland from somewhere not on that nation's exemptions list must self-isolate for two weeks from the day after they arrive. When you arrive in the UK, you must travel straight to the place where you will be staying. You must provide the authorities with the address where you will be staying, which can be your own home, with friends or family, a hotel or other temporary accommodation. If you are staying with other people, they do not need to self-isolate unless they have travelled with you, or you develop symptoms of the virus. While self-isolating you must not leave your accommodation for two weeks and must have food and other essentials delivered. If you do not have somewhere to self-isolate, you must tell officials, who can provide you with details of how to book somewhere to stay at your own expense. If someone in a school tests positive, they must be sent home to self-isolate for 14 days. The school will then contact their local public health protection team, who will advise on who else should be sent home. Anyone who has been in close contact with the person testing positive, will be advised to self-isolate for 14 days from their last date of contact. Anyone in England who does not self-isolate after a positive test could be fined up to Â£10,000. In Scotland, you can be currently be fined Â£480 for breaking the rules, in Wales the fine starts at Â£60 and doubles for each further offence, and in Northern Ireland fines can be up to Â£1,000. However, despite the threat of fines, a study of more than 30,000 people in the UK earlier this year suggested compliance was low. King's College London found that of people who reported the key Covid symptoms in the week ending 5 August, 18.2% said they had self-isolated. Of those contacted by NHS Test and Trace, 10.9% said they had stayed at home for the following 14 days.",2020-11-16T11:45:39,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-54239922,2020-11-17 10:02:17.336566,BBC,travel,0
Covid: What help is available to pay my bills?,"The UK's various lockdowns have one unifying feature - a squeeze on the finances of many whose jobs have been affected. There is some help available if you are struggling to pay your bills, but it will usually require action on your part.  This is many people's biggest monthly bill. Since the pandemic started, some two-and-a-half million homeowners have taken a mortgage holiday.  That means they deferred the payment, but will probably have to pay more each month when repayments resume. In England's new lockdown, anyone can still request a mortgage holiday, unless they have already had one for six months, the City regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - has proposed. A new one can last for six months. An existing one can be extended to last for six months in total. Applications can be made before the end of January, under the new plans. Under the FCA's plans, there will be no repossessions before 31 January, unless a homeowner specifically asks for one. In addition, a mortgage holiday should not show up on your credit record, so should not affect future borrowing. That said, future lenders may ask other questions to find out whether you have had previous difficulties paying. In these cases, the FCA proposes that your lender gives you ""tailored support"". They will assess your circumstances and devise an arrangement that could include extending the mortgage term, accepting partial payments, or - only in the short-term - another deferral. However, this will show up on your credit record. For tenants, the situation is less clear-cut.  The best option is to talk to your landlord, explain your circumstances and agree a payments arrangement. It is likely to be in the landlord's interests to do this, as eviction is likely to be a drawn-out process. Courts will remain open to hear eviction cases but, in England, bailiffs will not be used to enforce evictions until 11 January at the earliest - except in the most serious cases. There is some financial help to pay the rent through the benefits system if, for example, you are on universal credit. Some hardship funds are also available in some UK nations. Again, the FCA is proposing an extension of the payment deferrals system seen during the first lockdown. About two million people made use of payment holidays for loans, credit cards, and other debts in the spring and summer. Similar to the proposed mortgage system, payment holidays for credit can be extended to six months, or taken for the first time.  This is also true of motor finance, rent-to-own, and buy-now-pay-later products, and for pawnbroking customers. Again, if you have used up your six-month holiday, ask your lender for other, specific support. This will be marked on your credit file. There is short-term assistance for what is generally a short-term, high-cost product. Payday loan customers who have not yet had a payment deferral will be eligible for a one-month payment holiday. There is a host of free guidance and advice available, including:  During the spring lockdown and up until the end of October, borrowers had an interest-free buffer for the first Â£500 of an overdraft.  This is not being extended. So, customers are now facing overdraft interest rates, typically of 40% - a rise for many on what it cost at the start of 2020. Pre-payment meter users who cannot top up, possibly because they are self-isolating and cannot get to the shops, will be helped.  Meanwhile, any gas and electricity customer struggling to pay will be offered a ""realistic and sustainable repayment plan"".  So far, these have been voluntary agreements with suppliers, but will become a regulatory requirement from 15 December. Customers who had payment holidays or who are struggling financially may have their risk reassessed to make a policy cheaper, be given more time to pay, or have charges reduced or cancelled.  However, anyone finding it difficult must contact their insurer, rather than their insurer contacting them. Councils have a hardship fund designed to reduce payments for those finding it hard to pay. Bailiffs are unlikely to pursue other debts during lockdown. Lenders have a duty to identify and support those who are vulnerable, and mental health issues will fall into that category. Is is important to seek free, independent advice and not to bottle up any serious concerns. Nobody knows when that will be. The regulator is keen to stress that a debt problem delayed is not a debt problem solved, so you should make repayments if you can.",2020-11-06T00:04:09,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54800869,2020-11-13 14:46:54.037813,BBC,financial,0
Chinese county to review decision to ban public dog walking,"A county in China's Yunnan province has been forced to reconsider a policy banning residents from walking their dogs in public from 20 November. A circular said anyone caught doing so three times would have their pets confiscated and killed. Officials said it was to protect residents, as there had been incidents where unleashed pets had bitten people. However, the policy has been met with outrage on social media, prompting officials to say they would ""rethink"". ""These are uncivilised policies to promote 'civilised' dog-raising,"" one said, with others criticising the ""extreme"" measure. The circular issued on 13 November mandates pet owners to keep their dogs indoors at all times. It also says that the policy is to promote ""civilised"" dog-raising habits.  Dr Jaipal Singh Gill, executive director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Singapore, said that confining dogs indoors permanently can be ""detrimental to the animal's welfare"".  ""Instead of banning the walking of dogs, educating pet owners on responsible pet ownership and putting in place regulations can be considered instead,"" such as keeping a dog on a leash at all times, he said.  Under the new policy, pet owners who are caught walking their dogs in public will be issued a warning in the first instance.  If they are caught again, they will be fined between 50 yuan ($7; Â£5) and 200 yuan. A third violation will lead to their pets being confiscated and killed by local authorities.  In 2018, the city of Hangzhou banned dog walking during daytime and prohibited larger breeds. But if implemented, this will be the first time a ban on dog walking at any time of the day will come into effect. Shanghai, Qingdao and Chengdu have strict one-dog policies, where each household is restricted to having a single dog.  In Huangshi, residents are banned from raising large canines measuring over 45cm.",2020-11-17T06:09:10,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-54969685,2020-11-17 09:56:35.077820,BBC,world,0
I'm A Celebrity: First look behind the scenes of Gwrych Castle,"By Paul StanworthNewsbeat reporter in Abergele, North Wales Walk down the main street in Abergele, and you're in no doubt that I'm A Celebrity is in town. And if the show's hosts fancy a balti, a new caravan or any dental work during the series, it's clear they'll be well catered for. All down the street, shops have window displays featuring Ant and Dec's faces. A paint shop promises to cater for all your Dec-orating needs, accompanied by a picture of Mr Donnelly. ""I'm an optician,"" boasts another window ""get your eyes tested here!"" Production of the show has been moved to north Wales because of the coronavirus pandemic. Contestants including Radio 1's Jordan North and Eastenders' Shane Richie will move in this weekend ahead of Sunday night's launch show. Radio 1 Newsbeat was given rare access to the site right before filming started. But before we even got near the castle, it was clear the town was buzzing. Helping to document it all is Angela Jones, who normally works at the Venue Cymru theatre in Llandudno but is now off furlough thanks to I'm A Celeb. And she's not the only local enjoying a return to working life. ""There's a big team at the castle doing all the technical stuff,"" she says. ""Helping ITV with a bit of local knowledge.  ""I myself have been pulled in to work on an art exhibition. ""It's been amazing because I've not been able to work for about eight months. Being able to get back out the house, have a bit of routine - see daylight and see people - it's great!""  ""There's been a lot of hype,"" she goes on. ""We've seen a couple of helicopters flying over the last few days. So everyone's on tenterhooks."" So there's only one thing left to ask Angela. Which way to Gwrych Castle? (If you're not up to speed with the pronunciation, it's guu-REEKH, ending with a 'ch' sound as in 'loch'.) She points us in the right direction with a final warning: ""Apparently it's haunted."" ""I was in the castle last year and it's really creepy. Like, you're walking around and things definitely bump. ""They are gonna need their thermals in there too."" At the castle, it's clear she's right about the thermals. The breeze coming in off the Irish Sea is bitter. First impressions? The castle feels, and smells, old. There's the undeniable air of a graveyard among the ancient stones. The camp area, with its ivy-clad walls, feels very atmospheric. Hammocks and single beds are ready to receive their occupants. The sleeping bags feel thicker than usual but it's clear keeping warm will be a challenge. The contestants will need to collect wood and keep their boiler pumped up for hot water. And for a shower, celebrities will have to work in pairs, one pumping while the other stands under a dribbling watering can. Among the ruins is - surely - the busiest man in television right now. His name's Tom Gould and he's the show's creative director. Tom is getting ready for a programme that will be starkly different from its usual run but, at the same time, needs to feel familiar. ""There will still be a lot of elements that viewers will know and love,"" he tells us. ""They will still be celebrities stripped of their luxuries, they will still be facing their fears, they will still be living in a camp on basic rations of rice and beans. ""But dealing with the environment in Wales... is going to be a very different proposition to Australia. And also they'll be living in the castle and contending with whatever surprises that might have in store for them."" Ghosts? ""That's not for me to say. You can ask the celebrities after three weeks living there."" So far, so enigmatic. What other behind-the-scenes nuggets can Tom let us know? Well, the dunny is now the privy. But we got a glimpse of it and can confirm it's every bit as primitive as its jungle counterpart. The Bush Telegraph is now simply the Telegraph. And we will no longer see Kiosk Keith (or, latterly, Kiosk Kev) in his Outback Shack as part of the Dingo Dollar challenge. Now, celebrities will be visiting Ye Olde Shoppe, run by Kiosk Cledwyn, to spend their Castle Coins. It has, Tom says, been a ""massive undertaking"" to virtually rebuild the series from the ground up like this. But he's sounding confident. ""There will be a lot of challenges and the cold will definitely be one of them. But I think that it's a magical place that they're going into. ""It will be very different to the jungle, but I still think it will be a very special place."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Covid: Michigan and Washington State clamp down as US cases pass 11 million mark,"Michigan and Washington are the latest US states to bring in strict measures to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. High schools and colleges are to halt on-site teaching and restaurants are prohibited from offering indoor dining in Michigan from Wednesday. Indoor restaurant dining is also banned in Washington State, and gyms, cinemas, theatres and museums will close. Covid cases have now topped 11 million in the US, with daily cases rising by more than 100,000.  On average, more than 900 people a day are dying with the virus, and the overall death toll is now at least 246,210. The Trump administration struck an optimistic tone on Friday, saying they hoped to distribute 20 million doses of an approved vaccine in December, and for each month after that - although vaccines have yet to get official approval. President Donald Trump again ruled out putting the US into lockdown, but many states are introducing their own restrictions as fast rising cases threaten to overwhelm their healthcare systems. Both Michigan and Washington State have seen covid cases double in recent weeks. Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the state was ""at the precipice"" and could soon suffer 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths a week unless action is taken. As well as suspending in-person teaching and indoor dining, Ms Whitmer also ordered the closure of public entertainment venues for a period of three weeks. The curbs announced in Washington State come into effect on Monday evening and will last a month. ""Today, Sunday, November 15, 2020, is the most dangerous public health day in the last 100 years of our state's history,"" Governor Jay Inslee said. ""A pandemic is raging in our state. Left unchecked, it will assuredly result in grossly overburdened hospitals and morgues; and keep people from obtaining routine but necessary medical treatment for non-Covid conditions."" Oregon and New Mexico brought in tighter restrictions on Saturday.  California on Friday became the second state, after Texas, to hit one million Covid cases, prompting local officials to hit pause on reopening efforts. In other developments: Outbreaks in the spring and summer followed US schools' spring breaks and the national Labor Day holiday weekend - and now experts are concerned that as Thanksgiving approaches on 26 November, the spikes will again worsen. That is the situation playing out across the border in Canada, where people celebrated their Thanksgiving a month ago. The country's top doctors say that the holiday is partly why cities and provinces are now seeing record infections. Data shows that the majority of the US has rising ""community spread"" of the virus - situations where people get the virus without any known contact with a sick person. Indoor gatherings pose a large risk to spreading the virus, and as the holiday centres around eating together, wearing masks is not feasible.  One analysis from Georgia Institute of Technology researchers found the risk of having a Covid-positive individual at even a gathering of 10 people could be close to 100% in the worst-hit parts of the US. Back in October, Dr Fauci cautioned that the ""sacred"" American tradition of gathering together at Thanksgiving was ""a risk"". ""You may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering, unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected,"" Dr Fauci told CBS News.",2020-11-16T05:10:25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54955093,2020-11-16 08:04:51.502790,BBC,world,0
Greggs to cut 820 jobs amid lockdown sales slump,"Greggs is to cut more than 800 jobs because of a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said the Newcastle-based chain would not be ""profitable"" if action was not taken.  In a statement, he said he was ""saddened"" that cuts were necessary but ""the battle with Covid was intensifying further"".  In September, the bakery business said it was in talks with staff to cut hours to try and minimise job losses. Mr Whiteside said: ""Covid trading conditions have forced this action on to our business and we are all very saddened by the need to part company with around 820 friends and colleagues, many of whom have worked with us for many years. ""At lockdown levels of sales, even after all of the mitigating action that we have taken, Greggs will not be profitable as a business and there can be no room for complacency.""

What is devolution and how does it work across the UK?,"Boris Johnson has come under fire for reportedly telling Conservative MPs devolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. But what is devolution, and how does it work? For many years England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were run by the UK government, based in Westminster, in London.  But the way the UK is run was changed by devolution, which meant some powers were passed from Westminster to elected bodies in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh. Public votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and in both parts of Ireland in 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement.  This led to the creation of new elected institutions: the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The UK government in Westminster remains responsible for policy for England, and national policy in a number of areas. These include defence and national security, foreign policy, immigration, citizenship and tax - though Scotland has its own powers to raise income tax. The way it shares power with the institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland varies. The Scottish Parliament sits at Holyrood in Edinburgh. There are 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Scotland already had its own legal and education system. After devolution, it has become responsible for many areas: Its powers were extended in 2012, and again after the 2014 referendum on whether Scotland should become independent.  The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has formed the Scottish government at Holyrood since 2007, continues to argue for full independence. Since May 2020, the National Assembly of Wales has been known as the Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament). It meets in Cardiff Bay, and is made up of 60 elected Members of the Senedd (MS). The Senedd's responsibilities include: The Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast. There are 90 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Devolution in Northern Ireland is different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories: The main powers of Stormont are: In addition, the power-sharing agreement between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland is vital. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister jointly lead the government - one representing each of the two largest parties in power, in a mandatory coalition. Despite different job titles, they have the same powers. Northern Ireland's government was dissolved for three years after relations broke down between the governing parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in in January 2017.  But in January 2020, the two parties re-entered the devolved government after agreeing to work together again, alongside three smaller parties - the Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance.  Over the past 20 years, more powers have been given to local and regional mayors, in areas like transport and housing. There are now 24 directly-elected mayors across England.  The first was the mayor of London. The position was created, alongside the London Assembly, after a referendum in 1998.  The mayor of London has the most powers - and a budget of more than Â£18bn. The London mayor, currently Sadiq Khan, oversees Transport for London, policing and the fire brigade. The position has previously been held by Boris Johnson. Most of the other mayors were added following referendums held in 2002 and 2012. Some are in charge of a single local authority, as in Doncaster, Bristol and Middlesbrough. Others control an authority made up of several local councils. The powers the mayors have differ. In Liverpool City Region, for example, the mayor, Steve Rotherham, controls planning and strategy for transport, regional economic development and skills training. In Greater Manchester, the mayor Andy Burham's powers extend to social care, children's services and housing.",2020-11-17T13:51:02,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54974078,2020-11-18 08:25:40.891744,BBC,politics,0
Hurricane Iota: Category four storm hits Nicaragua,"Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua two weeks after another devastating storm hit. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said the storm crossed the coast on Monday evening. It had strengthened at sea to a category five storm before making landfall, with maximum sustained winds of up to 160mph (260km/h). As it struck Nicaragua it weakened to a category four, but the NHC said it remains ""extremely dangerous"".  The agency warned of ""catastrophic winds, [a] life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" in its latest update. ""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez of neighbouring Honduras said at an earlier press conference. Iota is the strongest Atlantic hurricane of the year and only the second November hurricane to reach category five - the last was in 1932. This year's Atlantic hurricane season has broken the record for the number of named storms. For only the second time on record officials have had to start using the letters of the Greek alphabet to start storm names. Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua have evacuated residents living in low-lying areas and near rivers in the Atlantic coastal region which Iota is expected to hit.  Before reaching Central America the storm moved past the Colombian island of Providencia in the Caribbean, cutting off electricity.  The country's President IvÃ¡n Duque said Providencia could have been hit badly by the storm and stressed there had been ""very poor"" communication after it struck. AFP news agency reports that one person was killed on the island. The effect of the rains could be particularly devastating in areas already drenched by Hurricane Eta two weeks ago. The NHC says Iota made landfall just 15 miles south of where that storm hit the coast on 3 November. Eta left at least 200 people dead. The worst-hit area was Guatemala's central Alta Verapaz region, where mudslides buried dozens of homes in the village of QuejÃ¡, with some 100 people feared dead.  At least 50 deaths were reported elsewhere in Guatemala.",2020-11-17T05:36:31,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-54969400,2020-11-17 09:55:00.769535,BBC,world,0
Prince Charles speaks of UK and Germany's 'enduring connections',"The Prince of Wales has spoken of the ""enduring connections"" between the UK and Germany as negotiators prepare for post-Brexit trade talks continue. Prince Charles said though politicians were discussing the ""shape"" of the countries' relationship, their ""fundamental bond"" would remain strong. His wife, Camilla, has joined him on their first official overseas visit since the start of the Covid pandemic.  Earlier, they attended a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial in Berlin. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are the first members of the Royal Family to attend the ceremony at the Bundestag, the German parliament, in Berlin, marking the country's National Day of Mourning for victims of war.  The prince told those gathered: ""The United Kingdom has chosen a future outside the European Union, and the relationship between our countries is evolving once again. ""Its shape is a matter negotiated between our governments and its essence is defined by the enduring connections between our people. ""It is, therefore, my heartfelt belief that the fundamental bond between us will remain strong: we will always be friends, partners and allies. ""As our countries begin this new chapter in our long history, let us reaffirm our bond for the years ahead."" The speech comes 75 years after the end of World War Two and as post-Brexit trade talks are reaching their crucial final stages. Earlier on Sunday, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed to Germany by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender on the steps of the Bellevue Palace in Berlin. The four then travelled to the Neue Wache Central Memorial, dedicated to victims of war and tyranny, where a wreath had been laid on behalf of the prince in front of a sculpture titled Mother With Her Dead Son.  The sculpture was designed by German artist Kathe Kollwitz in memory of her own son who died in World War One. Prince Charles briefly touched the wreath before joining the president and four other German dignitaries in a silence as a trumpet solo echoed through the building. The message on the prince's poppy wreath read: ""In everlasting remembrance of all victims of conflict and tyranny. Charles."" Camilla then laid a posy featuring rosemary for remembrance and olive, white daisies and nerines for peace.  Thee royal couple flew to Berlin Brandenburg Airport on Saturday evening in the UK's ministerial RAF Voyager jet - the first time it has flown dignitaries since a makeover costing almost Â£1m.  The prince, who celebrated his 72nd birthday on Saturday, was presented with a birthday cake during the flight. The Royal Family have carried out a number of European visits since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.  During a tour of Germany in May last year, Prince Charles said the bonds between the UK and Germany ""will, and must endure"" post-Brexit. And when his son, the Duke of Cambridge, visited the country in 2016, William said the depth of Britain's friendship with Germany would not change after the UK left the EU.  Ahead of his trip, the Prince Charles held a telephone meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",2020-11-15T14:55:16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54945343,2020-11-15 16:13:36.344516,BBC,world,0
Asia's forgotten musical gems rediscovered on vinyl,"By Nyshka ChandranReporter As the vinyl market experiences booming demand, crate diggers are spending time and money to re-release forgotten musical gems around Asia and beyond. Fariz Rustam Munaf, a prolific multi-instrumentalist better known as Fariz RM, was a household name in his native Indonesia during the 1980s.  Back then, both teenagers and adults grooved to his signature brand of jazz fusion, which incorporates elements of spacey disco and Brazilian samba.  Today, contemporary record labels are re-releasing his music for a new generation of listeners, with DJs routinely mixing his hit songs with electronic genres, such as Balearic house, at underground parties from Jakarta to Ibiza.  ""Being reissued is a great compliment,"" says the 61 year-old. ""It's a new period of my career. I feel like I've been reborn."" Around the world, artists such as Fariz RM are enjoying a resurgence of popularity thanks to the boom in reissues.  Record labels and curators are increasingly devoting significant resources to re-releasing tunes from earlier decades on vinyl, CD, cassette and on digital formats, in the hope of turning them into collectors' items.  Whilst the bulk of reissues tend to be classic albums, such as the Beatles' Abbey Road, a small but growing selection is devoted to obscure cuts of funk, psychedelia and traditional music from the developing world.  One such example is Sweet as Broken Dates: Lost Somali Tapes from the Horn of Africa - a compilation of Somali melodies from the 1970s and 1980s. The re-release, from New York-based Ostinato Records, was nominated for a Grammy in 2018.  Several imprints, such as Soundway Records, Habibi Funk, Sofrito and Strut Records, specialise in reissues of African, Caribbean, Latin, Arab and Asian rhythms from the 1950s-1980s. Good reissues tell a story, explain Dean Chew and Munir Harry Septiandry - two DJs who are working on a compilation of 1960s-1980s jazz, boogie and soul from north and southeast Asia.  The album, called Artifacts, is expected out next year and aims to cast light on a period of immense musical creativity in Asia. But hunting down these historic gems and obtaining copyright licences has been an arduous process. ""In Indonesia, for example, many record labels that released the songs we're looking for are obsolete,"" explains Septiandry, who produces dance music in the city of Bandung under the moniker Midnight Runners.  Septiandry recently put together a compilation of Indonesian progressive rock and city pop from 1979-1991 for US label Culture of Soul, an album that he believes will help spread global interest in Indonesia's sonic heritage. ""Poor archiving is also a big problem. Except for the major ones, most labels here don't have master tapes,"" he adds. If tracks are unreleased, or the label is defunct - says Septiandry - it can take intensive investigation to locate the source material: ""We start hunting down the artist, their friends and families - using contacts from the local music scene."" That was the case for Women Women Women, a moody synth masterpiece by South Korean artist Lee Dong Won, which also features on the Artifacts album.  ""It's becoming extremely tricky to license any song from that region now, so I had to really dig deep and approach producers in Seoul - who possess a deep pool of knowledge and could help me locate the copyright code,"" says Chew, who co-runs a record label in Singapore called Darker Than Wax. The exhaustive search to find obscure artists has been documented in films such as Searching for Sugarman and Ata Kak: Time Bomb and requires ""hours upon hours,"" adds Jan Hagenkoetter, of Germany's INFRACom Records.  Hagenkoetter has produced two compilations of Vietnamese music from the 1954-1975 era, called Saigon Supersound. The album traces a journey across surf rock, pop ballads and Latin-tinged swing which boasts clear US influences.  Hagenkoetter hopes the project will re-acquaint Vietnamese youth with their culture.  For many young Vietnamese at home and abroad, this type of music is what their parents listened to and it isn't considered cool, says Hagenkoetter, who lived in Ho Chi Minh City for many years.  ""I wanted to show that there's good music they can be proud of,"" he says. Reissues aren't a new phenomenon, but there's been an undeniable increase in recent years, amid the robust demand for vinyl.  Last year, for the 14th consecutive year, album sales on wax hit new highs in the US, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data.  It's a similar story in the UK, where vinyl LP sales have increased for 12 consecutive years, with 2019 marking the highest level of demand since the early 1990s, according to the British Phonographic Industry.  As a result, prices of limited-edition reissues have soared. Chew describes it as a chicken-and-egg situation: ""On one hand, you have dedicated labels that invest a great deal of blood, sweat and tears into reissues.  ""But on the other hand, reissues have gotten so trendy that they inevitably pave the way for countless regurgitations that eventually saturate the marketplace and send prices spiking on platforms like Discogs, where records have become commodities in a stock exchange."" Whatever the market's tricky economics, its social impact on artists has been overwhelmingly positive. The chance to be reintroduced to the public in an age of technology is a game-changer, explains Fariz RM.  During the 1980s, the pop legend wrote several tracks in English, in the hope of reaching fans beyond Indonesia, but he never knew whether he had succeeded ""because there was no social media"".  ""Back then, Indonesia's music industry never thought about entering international markets because they believed in the strength of local demand,"" says Fariz. Now, with two reissues under his belt, Fariz is more visible than ever.  ""I hear from DJs that my song Selangkah ke Seberang was popular in Ibiza; people in Peru tell me they're playing my music,"" he says, with a smile.  ""I'm happy - but of course, I wish it happened earlier.""",2020-11-18T01:54:15,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54904756,2020-11-18 08:24:35.529911,BBC,entertainment,0
Gaming and friendship apps: How I beat loneliness,"By Lindsay BrownNewsbeat reporter More people are feeling lonely now than at any point during the pandemic, new figures suggest. So with Covid restrictions still in place and winter looming, how can you beat loneliness? The office for national statistics (ONS) spoke to more than 4,000 people in Britain and a quarter said they are always, often or sometimes lonely. That figure rose to more than a third (34%) in 16 to 29 year olds. BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat has been speaking to young people about how they have tackled it - from finding friends online, bonding over Minecraft or simply calling mum. Samantha Nimmo got pregnant when she was 18 and gave birth at 19.  She says being a teen mum was very lonely as she didn't know anyone her age who was a parent. ""It was really isolating and really lonely - and the pandemic has made that worse.  ""You can't go to new mum groups, baby groups, or even going out for coffee - seeing family was really hard."" The student from Stirling, who's now 20, started writing poetry about her experiences as a new mum and posting it online. ""I post a lot of my work on Instagram - there's a lovely poetry community on there and I've met a few mums on there too."" A post shared by Sam Nimmo ð (@sn.poetry) ""I've met new friends online from it - we Zoom and chat - once the pandemic is over, we can hopefully all meet in person. ""It helps with the feelings of isolation and loneliness."" Megan O'Brien says she struggled when she moved cities for university in 2018. ""I wasn't physically alone, but I felt a bit lost so that made me feel lonely,"" Megan tells Newsbeat.  The 21-year-old got a flyer through her door from the charity Together Co, which has a befriending service. She contacted them and was set up with Lil, 79. It wasn't just Lil who benefitted from Megan's weekly visits. ""When you have someone to visit, it takes your mind off things for a bit and you can have a laugh"", Megan says. ""That lifts your mood generally."" The pair now chat for about two hours each week because they can't meet in person due to Covid-19 restrictions. ""We really do get on and we both can chat for hours. ""It's a nice feeling that someone wants your company and enjoys talking to you.""  Matthias Glenday, 21, says he often felt lonely growing up and never really fitted in at school. He met his first gaming friends when he started playing Minecraft at 11. Since then, he's developed a friendship group through gaming and has friends in Texas, Sweden and the UK - and they've met up several times in the flesh too. ""It sounds clichÃ©d, but we're a shoulder to cry on. I know almost everything about all of them.  ""We go through so much together - the passing of loved ones, mental health issues and medical issues.  ""I've got these people at my keyboard and answering in 30 seconds."" He says finding people like him was the key to beating loneliness.  ""There's a lot of people out there feeling lonely - and there's people waiting to make friends."" Moving to a new town, city or country can be a lonely experience.  For Lydia it was made even more difficult because of the pandemic.  The 24-year-old got a new job in Spain in July and struggled to find friends.  Someone she knew recommended the friendship app Bumble BFF. Lydia matched with Anna, also 24, and from the UK. ""We had lunch and and I don't know it just it all felt very comfortable very quickly, which was nice thing.  ""There were no pretences because nobody was trying to sleep with anyone. ""It was just, oh, I need a friend, you need a friend. Let's go and do something together.  ""It was quite relaxed and nice - since then we've of have met every week or so."" Jack Rigby says he experienced loneliness for the first time this year after he broke up with his partner during the pandemic. The 28-year-old had to move house and into a flat on his own, where he worked from home. Then he got Covid-19 and didn't see anyone for two weeks. He says calling his mum always helps. ""I think it's just important to talk about how you're feeling with as many people as possible - and you know, nobody's going to judge you. ""That's what's made a huge difference. ""If I'm having a day where I'm feeling rubbish and it's all getting a bit much, I pick up the phone or log in to Skype, and generally the people  you love and the people who care about you, they're there for those calls."" Nazia Hamidah had her baby daughter during lockdown and found she had little support.  The 29-year-old said being lonely was a ""big factor during lockdown"". ""I did feel really lonely because I didn't have my mum around, as she died two years ago, so that in itself was a big challenge. ""That was compounded by not having my sister or friends around.""  Nazia believes social media can have a positive impact when it comes to loneliness.  ""I started my own 'mummy blog' when my baby was three months old because thought maybe I could reach out to other mums who have also had a baby during lockdown. ""I found it very positive for me and I would encourage any other mums who want to connect to get a sense of community."" ""It's connected me with other mums. ""I gained a sense of community from it that I didn't have before"".  Psychologist Dr Julie Smith has given us her tips for tackling loneliness and helping others.

Gordon Brown: Scotland needs 'time to heal' before any referendum,"A referendum on Scottish independence should not be held while the country ""heals"" from coronavirus, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown said the country was facing ""huge problems"" and should not hold a referendum. ""We're in the middle of a virus, we're in the middle of a recession,"" he told BBC's Andrew Marr programme. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has said his party ""must"" plan for a referendum in 2021. Mr Blackford tweeted that a vote for the SNP in the Scottish Parliament elections next year would be a vote for a second referendum on Scottish independence. ""It is the people of Scotland who will determine our future. That is their right, sovereignty rests with us collectively. A vote for @theSNP in 2021 is for that right to be exercised, we know it, @BorisJohnson knows it,"" he said. Speaking in the Sunday National newspaper, Mr Blackford apologised for having to ""put off"" holding a referendum in 2020 as the Scottish government had to focus on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But Mr Blackford insisted that a referendum would happen and ""must take place in 2021"". However Gordon Brown said the country needed ""time to heal"" before ""any divisive, conflicting referendum that really will cause consternation in Scotland for months and months to come"". ""The question at the moment is not whether you could have a referendum, the question is whether you should have a referendum,"" the former Labour leader said. ""I see the SNP leader is saying there's got to be a referendum in 2021. I think most Scottish people will make up their mind that in the middle of a virus, when you've got to heal the virus, you've got to heal the recession and you've got to look at the whole future of Britain... I don't think this is the right time at all."" Mr Brown also told the BBC that a ""wholesale, root and branch constitutional review"" was needed to bring people together. ""It's not just a Scottish problem now. It's not even just a Welsh problem and a Scottish problem - you see the revolt of the regions round the United Kingdom,"" he said. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""It beggars belief"" that Mr Blackford should suggest that another referendum was needed. He added: ""Ian Blackford's commitment to a referendum a few months from now is not just irresponsible but delusional and shows how out of touch the SNP are. ""The Scottish Conservatives are focusing on fighting the pandemic and rebuilding the economy. That is what people want and expect."" ""They feel they're not listened to, the government doesn't consult. They've got the local knowledge but not the resources. The government's got the resources but not the local knowledge. This is now a UK problem.""",2020-11-15T13:10:55,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-54950002,2020-11-15 16:13:57.359460,BBC,politics,0
Black applicants least likely to be offered PhD places,"By Yasminara Khan and Joe CowellBBC Newsnight White applicants are offered places to study for a PhD at a higher rate than black, Asian and ethnic minority candidates, data obtained by BBC Newsnight has found. The programme sent freedom of information requests to 133 UK universities, requesting data for the academic years between 2015 and 2020. Of the 62 universities which responded, all but one had a higher acceptance rate for white applicants.  The data shows the imbalance was starkest for black applicants. Fifty one universities provided a detailed breakdown by ethnicity, and this showed black applicants had the lowest proportion of successful offer rates at 33 of these universities. This data includes offers to home and international applicants. A PhD is the highest academic qualification a student can achieve. The degree involves significant independent research into a chosen field. Getting a PhD is a crucial step to progress to an academic career. While at undergraduate level there are more ethnic minority students than ever before, this is not the case for PhD study. At postgraduate research level, the proportion of black and ethnic minority students drops drastically, although this can vary according to the area of study. From the data obtained by BBC Newsnight, one example showed there were 8,088 offers for white candidates, compared to only 386 for those of black ethnicity. Dr Jason Arday, an associate professor at Durham Universiity, is one of a minority of black academics in the UK.  ""Even though I did see a lot of black and [ethnic] minority students at university, I was never actually taught by a person of colour. So that was kind of the first notable omission that I saw,"" he told BBC Newsnight. Dr Arday has conducted research into black students' experiences across universities, and says the barriers are often subtle. They depend on things such as supervisors and lecturers selecting students at undergraduate level to progress onto PhD studies. ""The type of people I saw get cherry-picked were white middle-class people. And that never extended, in my opinion, to black or minority ethnic people."" A first-class or upper-second degree is normally required to go on to postgraduate research. A report by Universities UK shows that white undergraduate students are awarded higher grades in comparison to their black, Asian and minority ethnic peers. Former Education Secretary Damien Hinds spoke to BBC Newsnight about the degree attainment: ""I think your research on PhDs is important and ground-breaking. What we were absolutely aware of was this gap in attainment at firsts and 2:1s. The Office for Students is focused on this, trying to identify what the blockage is.""  Dr Suriyah Bi grew up in Alum Rock, Birmingham, one of the most deprived areas in the UK. She attended a local comprehensive school and - against all expectations - made it to Oxford University, and an academic career as a lecturer.  Dr Bi feels her background as a working-class Muslim Kashmiri woman was a block when trying to get into academia. ""The word 'PhD' was not in my vocabulary until I was an undergraduate at Oxford"", she told BBC Newsnight. ""I think when you have a number of multiple intersecting minority identities, you're carrying the burden of what each of those identities brings. And they combine and conflate and make it even more difficult for you."" Funding a PhD can be critical for people from low-income black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds.  Dr Arday says he had several jobs to pay for his degree, He adds that most of his peers secured funding for their doctorates, but he was not aware this resource was available. ""That information is inaccessible to black and ethnic minority prospective academics."" Dr Arday's experiences and research have left him reflecting about the challenges faced by black people in academia. ""Universities portray this veneer of egalitarianism, fairness, equality and diversity, but are actually one of the biggest facilitators of inequity,"" he said. ""I would always vehemently argue that academics have influence, and... I think it's really important that we should use that platform to challenge structural inequality.""

Brexit: What's happening and what comes next?,"It's been a hectic year in news, with the coronavirus pandemic and the US presidential election dominating the headlines. Brexit deadlines have come and gone, but now it's fair to say crunch time is fast approaching for the UK's departure from the European Union. So, given everything that's been going on, it feels like a good time to catch up on where we are. The UK actually left the EU on 31 January, but it's continuing to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year. These extra 11 months of transition were designed to give both sides some breathing room to negotiate a post-Brexit deal.  Such a deal would shape the UK's future relationship with its European neighbours, with key areas such as trade and immigration all under discussion. These negotiations are to determine the rules for the new UK-EU relationship which will start - whatever happens - on 1 January 2021. But remember: any deal would need to get the green light from parliaments on both sides, so time is running out. Well, they've ground to something of a standstill. Negotiations got under way in March, but progress has been fitful. Over the summer, the EU's top negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal seemed unlikely, while the UK said it was not afraid to walk away from the negotiating table all together. Not exactly positive then. The main sticking points have been fishing - namely how much access EU boats should have to UK waters - and state aid. The latter dispute revolves around whether the UK government should be allowed to subsidise failing companies, something that's generally not allowed under EU rules. The EU was also unhappy when the UK government published a controversial bill in September - the Internal Market Bill - that could overrule the Withdrawal Agreement already signed with the EU. The EU's concerns centre on the future arrangements for Northern Ireland. Talks began again in Brussels on Monday, in what is sure to be a crucial week. The sticking points, however, remain stubbornly in place. That's the million euro question. If a deal is not agreed before 31 December, the UK will leave the EU's main trading arrangements - the single market and customs union - and trade with the bloc on terms similar to, say, the US or China.  This would mean tariffs and border checks being applied to UK exports to the EU, while the UK would also have to decide what tariffs and checks to impose on goods coming the other way. All of this could push up costs for consumers. Full border checks could cause long delays at ports, while all sides have said they want to avoid checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (the only UK-EU land border).  Contingency measures could also be introduced for various economic sectors if there is no deal, in an effort to avoid the worst disruption on 1 January. A basic deal being agreed in time is still a possibility. Politicians on both sides, however, are going to have to make concessions fairly quickly. The agreement would need to be turned into a legal text, translated, and then ratified by parliaments on both sides, all before the looming 31 December deadline.  And even if a deal is struck, the UK-EU relationship will still be profoundly different come 2021. There will be far more bureaucracy for businesses that trade across the border, for example, and the free movement of people in both directions will come to an end.",2020-11-18T01:51:46,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54959056,2020-11-18 08:25:19.250421,BBC,travel,0
Man warned by police after shouting 'wakey wakey' in Gosport,"A driver who repeatedly shouted ""wakey wakey"" from his car in the early hours has been given a police warning. Hampshire Constabulary said it received ""many complaints"" about a man and his passengers shouting ""at the top of their voices"" in the Brockhurst and Elson areas of Gosport.    The red Nissan Navara driver was also seen turning off his lights and shouting ""you can't call the police because you can't see us"". The force said: ""How wrong he was.""  Resident Karen O'Brien, who runs Brockhurst Cafe, told the BBC at around 01.40 GMT on Tuesday or Wednesday she heard ""somebody on a megaphone shouting wakey wakey"".  She said: ""They did it twice and went up and down the road.  ""It was pretty loud, and it happened a couple of days later and woke my husband up. ""I spoke to my son and he heard it once, but he couldn't actually see anything out the window. Neither could I."" Officers eventually caught up with the 21-year-old driver, from Fareham, and issued him with a warning. The warning means the driver's car can be seized if he gives residents further unwelcome wakeup calls in the next 12 months.

Covid 19: Boris Johnson self-isolating as week of policy announcements begins,"Boris Johnson is beginning his first working day in self-isolation in Downing Street after meeting an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19. The prime minister said he was ""pinged"" by NHS Test and Trace on Sunday and told to self-isolate, but remains well. Mr Johnson on Thursday spent about 35 minutes with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who lost his sense of taste the next day. It comes as the government prepares a policy relaunch after fierce internal rows and departures from No 10. Downing Street said a series of ""critical announcements"" would this week detail Mr Johnson's ""ambitions for the United Kingdom"".  They follow the dramatic departure of the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings last week. Mr Johnson will chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". The PM will now be working from his flat at Downing Street. Mr Johnson wrote on Twitter on Sunday night: ""Today I was notified by NHS Test and Trace that I must self-isolate as I have been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.  ""I have no symptoms, but am following the rules and will be working from No 10 as I continue to lead the government's pandemic response."" In a WhatsApp message to Tory MPs seen by the BBC the PM added: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace continues to improve. The bad news is that I have been pinged!"" He said he would observe self-isolation rules despite ""following the guidance and socially distancing"" during his meeting with Mr Anderson. ""It doesn't matter that I feel fine - better than ever - or that my body is bursting with antibodies because I have already had the damn thing,"" he added. ""The rules are the rules and they are there to stop the spread of the disease."" In April, Mr Johnson spent three nights in intensive care after falling ill with coronavirus. He later said it ""could have gone either way"" and thanked healthcare workers for saving his life. It remains unclear what effect, if any, previously having the coronavirus has on a person's immunity but experts think reinfection is likely to be rare, BBC health correspondent James Gallagher has reported. On Thursday, Mr Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield, posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" On Sunday, he posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable, after they both tested positive. Boris Johnson will now have to stay at home in No 10. It means he will not be able to be in Parliament, though I'm told he will be working from Downing Street.  He does still intend to keep communicating with the country. It was supposed to be a pretty big week for Boris Johnson - he is trying to reset his government after some factional fighting in his office over the last few days. There are conversations taking place with the parliamentary authorities to see whether he can still contribute to the Commons. I think it is fair to say this has not come at the best time for Mr Johnson: he has big decisions to make on Brexit and what happens when England's lockdown ends on 2 December.  And it is also worth bearing in mind he was extremely ill with coronavirus earlier in the year and we do not know what getting the virus does for a person's immunity.  Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Sunday evening he was urgently exploring how to ""support additional virtual participation"" in the chamber. Such a move could allow more MPs, including Mr Johnson, to attend Commons' debates virtually and possibly even Prime Minister's Questions as he self-isolates. Earlier this weekend, senior Tory MPs said Mr Cummings' departure was a chance to ""reset government"" and a series of announcements are planned for this week. A meeting between the PM and the Northern Research Group of backbench Tory MPs had been scheduled for Monday. Officials also confirmed the government's 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" would be published ""to boost green jobs whilst invigorating plans to achieve net zero (emissions) by 2050"". Elements of that already announced include a new Â£40m investment in green spaces across England and Â£160m for the wind turbine industry.  In addition, another week of negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU are set to begin in Brussels. The transition period, which followed Brexit in January, ends on 31 December by which time a deal needs to be agreed and approved by parliaments in the UK and EU.  Chief UK negotiator David Frost has said there had been some progress between the two sides but that considerable differences remain. Meanwhile, in other coronavirus developments: The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.",2020-11-16T05:33:25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54956076,2020-11-16 08:04:30.316396,BBC,politics,0
Covid-19: MPs with cancer 'excluded' from cancer debate,"MPs have called for wider virtual participation to be allowed in Parliament, arguing that those with cancer were ""excluded"" from taking part in a debate on the illness. And ex-minister Tracey Crouch, who has cancer, expressed disappointment she could not speak in the debate.  Labour's Chris Bryant said this was due to Jacob Rees-Mogg's reluctance to allow greater use of video links. But the Commons leader said it was down to a lack of broadcasting equipment. Mr Rees-Mogg has previously argued that virtual working was not an effective way to hold the government to account - and was no substitute for the ""cut and thrust"" of live debate. Currently MPs who cannot be in Westminster due to coronavirus are only able to take part in some events. They can put questions to ministers by video link but are not able to contribute to general debates on legislation or events in Westminster Hall - a separate chamber from the House of Commons. Those trying to avoid travel during the pandemic are also able to register for proxy votes.  On Thursday a debate on breast cancer services took place in Westminster Hall and Conservative MP Ms Crouch said because of Mr Rees-Mogg's ruling, those ""with real and current life experience of the disease are disappointingly unable to participate"". ""While I respect his commitment to traditional parliamentary procedures, I'm sure if he was on the backbenches and not the fine specimen of health and fitness he clearly is, he would be arguing forcefully for members to be able to contribute more often in proceedings by modern technology."" She asked him to ""please stop thinking those of us at home are shirking our duties"" and urged him to allow virtual participation in Westminster Hall.  Leader of the House Mr Rees-Mogg replied that when events in Westminster Hall restarted, following the Covid lockdown, ""the broadcasting facilities were already being fully utilised"". ""So it wasn't an issue then of whether we wanted to do it or not, it simply wasn't an option,"" he said.  However, he also added there needed to be a balance between the needs of MPs with the needs of the House of Commons ""to proceed with its business"". Mr Bryant said it was ""appalling that Tracey Crouch is excluded from a debate on breast cancer because she's recuperating from cancer by Jacob Rees-Mogg rules"".  His party colleague Barbara Keeley agreed and said she was also ""excluded"" having just been through breast cancer treatment.

Coronavirus: Germany hails couch potatoes in new videos,"Videos released by the German government have humorously praised the nation's couch potatoes as the country battles a second wave of coronavirus.  The first advert, entitled ""#specialheroes - Together against corona"", depicts an elderly man looking back on the winter of 2020. ""The fate of this country lay in our hands,"" he says. ""So, we mustered all our courage and did what was expected of us, the only right thing. ""We did nothing. Absolutely nothing."" The federal government has said the comical videos are a clear message to the public that reducing contact with others is vital in preventing the further spread of the virus. The German Govt's latest Corona advert - now subtitled in English. Quite good. pic.twitter.com/nbRZIm9RcN ""Our couch was the frontline and our patience was our weapon,"" the first ad says. A second video features his girlfriend, while a third depicts a man looking back at his days gaming during lockdown. ""Before the pandemic, I was without doubt the laziest person to tiptoe through this country, I almost never left my flat, played computer games without any kind of ambition and ate cold ravioli straight from the tin because I was too lazy to heat it up,"" the man says.  ""My friends called me Lazy Toby but I was too lazy to get annoyed about that,"" he says.  ""And when the virus spread, I remained the same lazy sack of potatoes that I was before. But unlike me, the world had changed: to contain the virus, people were urged to stay at home, doing nothing suddenly became a public service, laziness could save lives and I was a champion in that."" The videos have caused a stir on social media, with many praising them. It is superb, and especially funny to me because he says, ""Absolut gar nichts! Faul wie WaschbÃ¤ren!"" *exactly* the way my German grandparents did when they muttered about me for being a lazy teenager who just laid around all day on the couch. https://t.co/Kl3KcJ3Ri5 Sawsan Chebli, a politician from the Social Democratic party, tweeted: ""So strong. So heart-warming. And so damn important."" But not everyone has taken to them. Some have criticised the videos due to their apparent drawing of comparisons with World War Two. ""They not only mock the dead of World War Two, but also the people who survived the front and were able to talk about it,"" one user wrote. Christine Richter, a communications expert from Cologne, told public broadcaster WDR that she had mixed feelings.  On the one hand, drawing parallels between now and the war posed ethical questions, Ms Richter said. But she also praised the ""humorous and emotional"" approach from the government.  ""That is exciting,"" she said.  These are the latest comical coronavirus ads to cause controversy in the country.  Last month, Berlin's tourism authority launched a campaign featuring an elderly woman giving the middle finger to people who refuse to wear face masks. Germany has reported 10,824 new cases in the last 24 hours, with 62 deaths. The overall death toll now stands at 12,547.  The country is already under partial lockdown, with bars, restaurants and entertainment venues shut. The federal government is pressing for tighter curbs, including mask-wearing in schools at all times for teachers and all age groups, and allowing individuals from one household to meet publicly with no more than two from another household.",2020-11-16T12:44:12,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54959871,2020-11-17 09:56:55.008101,BBC,travel,0
Covid: What is mass testing and how does it work?,"By Ian WestbrookBBC News A mass coronavirus testing programme has been taking place in Liverpool. There are now plans to extend it to other parts of England, and to students around the UK before they return home for Christmas. How does mass testing work and what does it achieve?  Mass testing means asking everyone to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. The idea is to find healthy people who may be infected, but not yet displaying symptoms. They can then be told to isolate and be prevented from spreading the virus.  Currently, across most of England, people can only have a test if they already have symptoms. But during the Liverpool pilot, everyone living or working in the city is being offered a voluntary test. Mass testing can be used in more targeted ways, including: Mobile testing sites have been set up across Liverpool, in places like care homes, schools, universities and workplaces.  People might be invited by their local authority to come for a test but they can also book their own online, or whole families can just turn up in their car.  About 2,000 military personnel are helping with logistics and delivering the tests across a potential 85 sites. More than 23,000 people have been tested in Liverpool since the pilot began, with 154 people receiving positive results. The city has a population of about half a million. The scheme is now going to be rolled out to 67 more areas in England, including Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, the North East and parts of the West Midlands, North West and London. Plans have also been drawn up to ensure university students in England and Wales can go home safely for Christmas, after being tested. Plans for Scotland will be announced later on Wednesday. NHS staff will also start being tested for coronavirus twice a week. Routine testing of health workers already happens in the areas hardest hit by the virus. The Liverpool pilot offers two types of testing, both involving swabbing the nose or throat - a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, and a lateral flow test. The PCR test is regarded as the ""gold standard"" by epidemiologists, but may take up to a day or longer to produce a result as the sample is sent off to a laboratory. It is, however, the one used most around the world. The lateral flow test involves a handheld kit that gives a result - a bit like a pregnancy test - in about 20 minutes, without the need for a lab. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on one end, then a marking appears if you are positive. Liverpool's public health director Matthew Ashton said the city has the capacity to carry out 50,000 lateral flow tests and 14,000 PCR tests a day.   Anyone who tests positive during the pilot must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. Their contacts will be traced by NHS Test and Trace.  All other people in their household must also self-isolate for 14 days from the day the person first became ill, or from the day of the test, if they have no symptoms. Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise. People should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to help out by getting what is needed and leaving items outside the front door. Anyone in England who fails to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to Â£10,000. Anyone on low income who was instructed to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace should be able to claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority. In September, Mr Johnson outlined his ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring. He said that ""in the near future"" he wanted to start using testing to allow people who tested negative ""to behave in a more normal way"".  Other countries have already introduced mass testing programmes.",2020-11-11T13:52:56,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-54872039,2020-11-13 14:46:28.899338,BBC,travel,0
Coronavirus: How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolating at No 10 after NHS Test and Trace told him he had been in close contact with someone who later tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Johnson spent about 35 minutes with MP Lee Anderson, who lost his sense of taste the next day. Refusing to self-isolate when told to is now illegal in England, with fines of up to Â£10,000. You can download the app on a smartphone - but not on tablets, smartwatches or other devices. To get started, go to Android's Google Play or Apple's App Store and search for ""NHS Covid-19"". Your phone must have Android 6.0 (released in 2015) or iOS 13.5 (released in May 2020) and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. That excludes the iPhone 6 and older versions of Apple's handsets. Some more recent Huawei phones will not load the app either. The app can detect when a fellow app user is nearby. When two phones running the app are near each other, they will make contact through Bluetooth.    If they are close for a long enough time, and one of the two owners later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.  You can also use the app to check in at venues - for instance, shops, bars, restaurants or places of worship. Hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will be asked to display posters with a QR code, which app users will be able to scan.  The posters will also go up in communal areas of community buildings such as universities, hospitals and libraries.   Used alongside manual contact tracing, the app will help identify close contacts of a user who tests positive, or visitors to a premises that has suffered an outbreak.  Northern Ireland launched an app in July, while Scotland's app was launched in September. People who display coronavirus symptoms and test positive have been contacted by text, email or phone. England's NHS Test and Trace service calls only from 0300 0135 000. They are asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website and give personal information, including:  Close contacts are:  Contact must have taken place within a nine-day period, starting 48 hours before symptoms appeared.  No-one who is then contacted will be told your identity. If you are approached because one of your contacts has tested positive, you must stay at home for 14 days from your last point of contact with them.  You must self-isolate, even if you don't have symptoms. Others in your household won't have to self-isolate unless they also develop symptoms, but must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. The prime minister claimed the UK's test and trace system would be ""world-beating"". But it has encountered several problems since its launch in May.  Of those transferred to the contact tracing system between 29 October and 4 November in England, 85.0% were reached and asked to provide information about their contacts. This has remained broadly similar since Test and Trace began, although increased slightly, over the past month. For those where communication details were available, 78.3% were reached and asked to self-isolate. Sage, which advises the government, has said that at least 80% of contacts would need to isolate for it to work properly. The mobile app was meant to launch in mid-May and form a key component of the UK's tracing strategy. But the original attempt, which used a ''centralised'' approach to storing data, had to be abandoned. An NHS Test and Trace call does not always mean a pub or restaurant must close. It depends on the circumstances and when the infected person visited.   ",2020-11-16T12:38:45,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52442754,2020-11-17 10:02:40.121877,BBC,travel,0
Covid: How close are we to a vaccine?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent Hopes are rising that an effective vaccine against Covid-19 will be available within the next year. Preliminary findings show a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. Meanwhile results from other advanced trials are expected soon. If you want your life to get back to normal, then we need a vaccine. Even now, the vast majority of people are still vulnerable to a coronavirus infection. It is only the restrictions on our lives that are preventing more people from dying.   But vaccines safely teach our bodies to fight the infection. This can either stop us catching coronavirus in the first place or at least make Covid less deadly. The vaccine, alongside better treatments, is ""the"" exit strategy. Pfizer/BioNtech is the first pharmaceutical company to share data from the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial.  This is a crucial point in vaccine development, where some experimental vaccines will fail.  About 43,000 people have been given the vaccine, and no safety concerns have been raised.  Trial results are also due in the next few weeks on a vaccine being developed by British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and scientists at the University of Oxford. Meanwhile encouraging data on a Russian vaccine called Sputnik V has also been released. Based on interim results from a phase 3 trial, the same stage reached by the Pfizer jab, Russian researchers report that it is 92% efficient. More results from other teams working on advanced trials are also expected in the coming weeks and months.  There are several other vaccines in the final stage of testing, including Moderna in the US,  Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Sinopharm in China, and Gamaleya Research Institute in Russia.  However, a trial in Brazil for a drug developed by the Chinese firm Sinovac has been suspended after what was described as a ""severe adverse incident"" - believed to be the death of a volunteer. The point of a vaccine is to harmlessly expose parts of the virus to the immune system, which then recognises it as an invader and learns how to fight it. There are many ways to do this and researchers are using different approaches.  Pfizer/BioNtech (and Moderna) have developed what's known as an RNA vaccine. This uses an experimental approach, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body, in order to train the immune system. Once inside the body, this starts making viral proteins to train the body. This is a completely new technique. The Oxford and Russian vaccines take a harmless virus that infects chimpanzees, and genetically modify it to resemble coronavirus, in the hope of getting a response. Two of the big China-made vaccines use the original virus but in a disabled form, so it cannot cause an infection.  Understanding which method produces the best results will be vital. Challenge trials, in which people are deliberately infected, could help answer these questions. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and about 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of 2020, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. Astra Zeneca/Oxford has agreed to supply 100 million doses of its vaccine to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful.  Exactly who will be immunised first will depend on where Covid is spreading when the vaccine becomes available and in which groups it is most effective.  Older care home residents and care home staff are top of the UK's preliminary priority list. They are followed by health workers such as hospital staff and the over 80s. Age is, by far, the biggest risk factor for Covid, so the older you are, the sooner you are likely to be vaccinated.  It is thought that 60-70% of the global population need to be immune to the virus in order to stop it spreading easily (known as herd immunity) - in other words, billions of people, even if the vaccine works perfectly. Not everyone responds the same to immunisation.  People will be watching the results in older people closely, because they are most at risk from the virus.  But history also suggests any vaccine could be less successful in old people because an aged immune system does not respond as well to immunisation. We see this every year with the annual flu jab. It may be possible to overcome this by either giving multiple doses or giving it alongside a chemical (called an adjuvant) that gives the immune system a boost.

The heartbreaking video and the death of a Kurdish-Iranian family,"By Jiyar GolBBC Persian A video clip of a Kurdish-Iranian girl who died with her family attempting to cross the English Channel last month highlights their drive for a better life.  The clip shows a nine-year-old girl crying and laughing. ""My name is Anita Iranejad, I am from Sardasht,"" she says. It is a screen test for a short film to be shot in her hometown. In the background, her father Rasoul Iranejad can be heard gently prompting her: ""I would like to be an actressâ¦ say it.""  The video suggests not just paternal pride, but ambition. Rasoul wants his daughter to achieve her dream. But that is a tall order for a little girl from this impoverished and politically oppressed region. The family are from Sardasht, a small, predominantly Kurdish city in western Iran A year after the screen test, Rasoul, his wife Shiva Panahi, and their three children Anita, six-year-old Armin and baby Artin, 15 months, embarked on a dangerous journey to Europe.  But the family's hopes for their future were brought to a brutal end in the English Channel on 27 October. A small boat heading to the UK in rough conditions capsized just a few kilometres into its journey. Shiva and the children were trapped without life jackets inside the cabin.  Rasoul, 35, left Iran with his family in early August. Relatives did not want to comment directly on why they left, but there are many reasons why they might have wanted to start again somewhere else. Sardasht, in west Azerbaijan province close to the border with Iraq, is a difficult place to realise any ambition beyond sheer survival. With little significant industry, it has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, and holds few prospects for its predominantly ethnic Kurdish population. Many are forced to resort to smuggling goods over the border into Iraqi Kurdistan. This is neither profitable - they earn less than $10 a trip - nor safe.  In the past few years, hundreds of them have been shot dead or injured by Iranian border guards. Many have fallen to their deaths from the rough mountainous terrain or been buried by avalanches in winter.  The region is also heavily militarised. Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, there has been conflict between Iranian security forces and armed Kurdish groups fighting for their rights. Iran labels them separatists backed by foreign powers. Some 10% of Iran's population of 82 million are Kurds, and yet they make up more than half of the country's political prisoners, according to the UN.  There was a brutal crackdown from the authorities during and in the aftermath of anti-government protests in Iran last year, which exploded in the predominantly Kurdish towns on the western border with Iraq, as well as on the outskirts of Iran's major cities. A friend of Shiva's told the BBC that Rasoul, 35, wanted to escape persecution.  She says that Shiva sold everything they had and borrowed money from friends and family to pay smugglers to take them to Europe. They wanted to get to the UK, which is a popular choice for Kurdish asylum seekers. They believe the UK takes a relatively small number of refugees, compared with other European countries, so they will have better prospects there.  Their first stop was Turkey. A video clip shared with the BBC by Rasoul's friends shows him singing in Kurdish, while the family waits for smugglers to take them to Europe. ""There is pain [in] my heart, huge sadness â¦ but what can I do, I have to leave my Kurdistan and goâ¦,"" he sings, his son Armin laughing in delight. His baby Artin toddles towards him and sits on his knee.  There is a famous saying among the Kurds: ""We have no friends other than mountains."" After the end of World War One, and the collapse of the Ottoman empire, the Kurds were promised independence by victorious allied powers, but the regional powers never accepted that deal - instead their homeland was eventually divided among the new nations of the Middle East. Since then, any moves by Kurds in Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq to set up an independent state have been quashed. It used to be the case that Turkey was the final destination for thousands of Iranian refugees, but in the past seven years the political climate has meant this is no longer a viable choice.  There are reports from migrants that Turkish security forces have abused Kurdish refugees in police stations or deported them to Iran upon arrival. There have even been a number of political assassinations and kidnappings of Iranian dissidents in Istanbul.  So Rasoul and Shiva would have been keen to move on.  In September they found a smuggler and paid 24,000 Euros [$28,243] to be ferried from Turkey to Italy, and then taken by lorry to northern France. Charlotte Decanter, a volunteer for the Adra charity in the coastal city of Dunkirk, says she met Shiva while distributing food at Grande-Synthe, the main camp for Kurdish migrants and refugees.  She was struck by her vivacity. ""A small woman, very kind, very sweet. I said a few words in Kurdish. She laughed a lot. She was stunned.""  But somewhere along their journey in France disaster had struck. Shiva and Rasoul were robbed of their possessions. In texts Shiva sent on 24 October to a friend in Calais, she acknowledges the journey by boat will be hazardous, but says they don't have the money for a lorry trip.  ""I know it's dangerous but we have no choice,"" she texts. She makes it clear how desperate she is to find refuge. ""I have a thousand sorrows in my heart and now that I have left Iran I would like to forget my past."" A friend of Rasoul's who travelled with the family to France says that on the evening of 26 October the smuggler in Dunkirk said it was time to make the crossing the next day. They left in the early morning from a beach called Loon Plage, a desolate spot next to an oil depot.  The weather was extremely rough, with gusts of wind up to 30km per hour and waves about 1.5m high. The friend, who calls himself Aware, decided it wasn't worth the risk. ""I was scared, I refused to go,"" says Aware. ""I begged Rasoul that he shouldn't go either. But he said he had no choice.""  Rasoul paid the smugglers around Â£5,500, according to relatives in Iran. Ebrahim Mohammadpour, a 47-year-old actor and documentary filmmaker from Sardasht, who was also on the boat with his brother Mohammad, 27, and his 17-year-old son, says the craft was only 4-4.5 metres long and designed for eight people, not the 23 that were crammed on to it.   ""Honestly we were totally blind because we [had already] suffered so much in this journey,"" says Ebrahim. ""First you think, 'I don't want to get on the boat,' but then you say, 'I will board just to leave this misery."" Yasin, a 16-year-old who was also on the boat, says only he and two others - no-one in Rasoul's family - were wearing life jackets. The 22 passengers were all Kurds from Sardasht, and the pilot was a refugee from northern Iran, they say. Iranian migrants who have previously made the journey to the UK tell me smugglers usually ask the passenger who has the least money to drive the boat. Shiva and the children went into the glass-partitioned cabin, which would have seemed warmer and safer. But it turned out to be deadly. After around eight kilometres, the boat filled with water, according to Ebrahim.  ""We tried to remove the water, but we couldn't. We wanted to return to Calais but we couldn't,"" he says. His brother Mohammad says the passengers began to panic, lurching from one side of the vessel to the other, before the boat suddenly capsized. It's difficult to establish exactly what happened next, as the accounts of survivors are confused.  All say that initially at least, Shiva and her children were trapped in the cabin.  Ebrahim says that Rasoul dived under the water to try and rescue them, and came up again to cry for help.  Peshraw, a university student, says he tried to break the glass of the cabin with a carpet cutter but was unable to even crack it. He says that he saw baby Artin floating inside. Shiva's brother Raso told us he heard Rasoul managed to pull Artin out, then went inside for the others. Ebrahim sobs as he recalls the moment he saw Anita floating in the water, and managed to grab her. ""I held the child in the water. I thought she might be alive. With one hand I was holding onto the boat and with another, I was holding the child. I kept shaking her to see if she was alive but there was no response,"" he says. ""I can't forgive myself,"" he cries. Rasoul emerged from the boat moaning, and crying out the names of his family, according to Ebrahim's brother Mohammed, and then just let himself be taken by the waves.  A passing sailing boat raised the alarm at 0930 local time, and began to help those in the water, according to the French authorities. The first rescue ship arrived 17 minutes later, they say.  The authorities say that some people were taken out of the water in cardiac arrest, but will not go into details. The survivors we spoke to believe Rasoul, Shiva, Anita and Armin had already died. Fifteen other people were taken to hospital. Baby Artin is still missing, presumed dead. Yasin says he saw him swept away in the water.  An Iranian man accused of being the captain of the boat has appeared before an investigating judge in France and is set to faces charges of manslaughter. Shiva's brother and sister, who both live in Europe, travelled to a morgue in Dunkirk to identify the bodies, and were hoping to repatriate them on Friday.  The numbers of migrants attempting the perilous journey across the Channel is on the rise. In 2018, 297 people reached the UK in small boats, 1,840 did so in 2019, and nearly 8,000 people have made the journey this year, according to BBC analysis.  At least 10 people have died while attempting this since 2019. Most of the asylum seekers come from Iran. Refugee charities and French politicians argue that would-be asylum seekers should be allowed to apply for sanctuary before they arrive in Britain. Ebrahim says the survivors have nightmares.  Despite this, Yasin says he will try again to cross the Channel.  ""Everyone was sad, I was very scared too. But I just want to be in a safe place. I will try again.""",2020-11-15T00:11:42,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-54892785,2020-11-15 16:18:09.569282,BBC,world,0
Corrie Mckeague: Missing airman 'died after climbing into bin',"An airman who went missing four years ago is thought to have died after he climbed into an industrial waste bin, an inquest heard.  Mr Mckeague, 23, who was based at RAF Honington, Suffolk, is believed to have died on 24 September 2016 after a night out in Bury St Edmunds. Despite extensive searches, his body has never been found.  The inquest was opened at Suffolk Coroner's Court and was adjourned for a pre-inquest review in February. Ch Supt Marina Ericson from Suffolk Police said Mr Mckeague had been on a night out in Bury St Edmunds and was ""very drunk"" when he was asked to leave the Flex nightclub.  She said Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was ""happy and friendly throughout the night"" and was last seen alive at 03:25 BST walking into a horseshoe-shaped area behind Greggs and Superdrug, where industrial waste bins were stored. A Biffa refuse lorry drove into the area less than an hour after the last sighting of Mr Mckeague. The lorry's load weighed 116kg, 70 to 80kg more than average, she told the hearing in Ipswich. The airman's mobile phone mapped the same route as the bin lorry to Barton Mills, she said. Ch Supt Ericson said it was believed Mr Mckeague had climbed into the Greggs waste bin and was inside it when it was emptied into the Biffa lorry. ""That was where he subsequently died,"" she said.  The chief coroner for England and Wales directed the inquest be held into the death, following a request from Mr Mckeague's family. Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, previously said she hoped the inquest would ""be able to tell me, and us as a family, that there is just nothing else that we could do or be able to do to find Corrie"". The Suffolk Police investigation into the disappearance was handed to the cold case team in 2018.  At the time, the force said the evidence pointed to Mr Mckeague have been ""transported from the 'horseshoe' area in a bin lorry and ultimately taken to the Milton landfill site"". As part of the inquiry, which cost more than Â£2m, police trawled the landfill site in Cambridgeshire. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Doug Emhoff: The first 'second dude' in the White House,"By Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington The moment that Kamala Harris celebrated the news she would be the next vice-president - captured on camera for posterity - was history making three times over. Come January, she will become the first female, first black and first Indian American vice-president. But the person behind the camera will be making history too. Ms Harris's husband, Douglas Emhoff, will become the country's first second gentleman. He was already the first male spouse, at all, on a winning presidential ticket.  The 56-year-old has so far seemed to relish his role as a political partner. He became a star surrogate during Ms Harris's own presidential bid, and often refers unironically to the #KHive - the name for Ms Harris's most dedicated supporters. His social media feeds resemble unofficial fan pages for his wife.  In August, Mr Emhoff announced a leave of absence from his legal career to support the Biden-Harris ticket full-time.  ""He does seem to have really taken to it,"" said Aaron Jacoby, a longtime friend and former legal partner of Mr Emhoff. ""You could expect him to be a fish out of water - he's not. He's just swimming and enjoying it.""  Now, as the Biden-Harris team prepares for their move to the White House, how Mr Emhoff takes on his role may signal a step forward for gender equality, as well as the distance left to go.   In 2013, Mr Emhoff, then a Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, was set up on a blind date with then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris. A nervous Mr Emhoff left Ms Harris a rambling and ""really lame"" voicemail trying to arrange their first meeting, he said.  They met for dinner and the very next day, Mr Emhoff emailed her with all his available dates for the next few months to come, Ms Harris wrote in her 2013 memoir, The Truths We Hold. ""I'm too old to play games or hide the ball"", he said. ""I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work."" Less than a year later, they were married at the Santa Barbara courthouse, in a ceremony that paid tribute to both her Indian heritage and his Jewish faith. Ms Harris saved that first voicemail and plays it every year on their anniversary.  Through their marriage, Ms Harris became a stepmother, or ""Momala"", to Cole and Ella, Mr Emhoff's children from his first marriage to Kerstin Emhoff, the co-founder and chief executive of production company Prettybird.  Ms Harris has said it was meeting Cole and Ella that ultimately ""reeled [her] in"". Likewise, for the Emhoff kids. In an interview with Glamour magazine this year, Cole, 26, said that meeting Ms Harris ""for all of usâ¦ was love at first sight"".  Mr Emhoff and his first wife are famously friendly. ""We remain incredibly close"", he said in an April interview with Chasten Buttigieg - husband of former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. And Ms Emhoff and Ms Harris get along ""amazingly"", he said. During Ms Harris's own bid for president, Ms Emhoff - who frequently tweets her support for the Harris-Biden ticket - lent her creative services to the campaign.   ""They were like, 'the ex-wife wants to do what?'"" she told Marie Claire in October.  Now, on the trail, in interviews and across social media, Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff seem to be a genuinely happy couple. ""What you see is what they're really like, this is not an act,"" said Alex Weingarten, a long-time friend and former colleague of Mr Emhoff. ""They are incredibly loving and affectionate with each other. It's unmistakableâ¦ how really in love they are.""  Mr Emhoff experienced his first real campaign as a political spouse when Ms Harris ran for Senate in 2016. But that campaign, he said, didn't prepare him ""at all"" for the magnitude of his wife's presidential bid.   In January 2019, Ms Harris officially launched her campaign to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland, California.""I'm out there waving, I'm freaking out... we thought there'd be 5,000 people there,"" Mr Emhoff said about the day.   In the months to come, Mr Emhoff would work at his law firm during the week, and on weekends be dispatched across the country - increasingly without Ms Harris - as her surrogate.  While his wife, the candidate, was given briefing books and staff, he would just ""roll out and do it"", he said. ""It was really trial by fire.""  Recounting his time on the trail, Mr Emhoff often becomes most animated talking about the campaign's smaller events - naming one in Flint, Michigan, another in rural Nevada. He'd come back to the Harris campaign with his self-styled ""notes from the field"" recounting whom he had met and what he had seen.  ""You just get overwhelmed because you just want to help all these folks and help the campaign,"" he said. In June of that year, Mr Emhoff earned online attention after leaping on stage at a presidential forum to defend Ms Harris from a protester who had grabbed the microphone out of her hands. Footage of the incident showed him pulling himself up on stage from the front row, before wrestling the microphone back for his wife.  Mr Emhoff befriended a number of the Democratic candidates' spouses, becoming particularly close with Mr Buttigieg - who was the first person to text Mr Emhoff when Ms Harris dropped out. Through a representative, Mr Buttigieg declined to be interviewed for this story. Mr Emhoff's lack of political experience has not been a hurdle on the trail.  ""I think while it may have surprised him or any of us that he's been thrust into the political spotlight - it actually is perfect for his personality,"" said friend and colleague Aaron Jacoby. ""He really is that happy, engaging, supportive person that you see.""   In interviews, he seems laidback, relaxed, typically Californian. He's partial to the words ""amazing"", ""surreal"" and ""awesome"". He calls himself a dude, as in - ""I was a dudeâ¦ then I met Kamala"".  Asked to describe Mr Emhoff, both Mr Jacoby and another long-time friend, Alex Weingarten said he was ""authentically Doug"".  ""He's just a good dude,"" said Mr Weingarten. ""I think it all came very naturally to him, because Doug is naturally a people person.""  He has also become an ""incredibly forceful advocate"" for the Biden-Harris ticket, Mr Weingarten said, a role suited for the experienced litigator.   Mr Emhoff and Ms Harris have their legal degrees in common, but while his wife went straight to work as a state prosecutor, the incoming second gentleman entered a nearly 30-year career in corporate law.  During this time - in addition to business and real estate disputes - his clients have included the pharmaceutical company Merck, in cases alleging one if its products caused bone disease and the arms dealer Dolarian Capital. And while Mr Emhoff was not personally registered to lobby, his most recent firm DLA Piper, has an active lobbying practice in Washington.  Perhaps heading off possible conflict of interest charges, the Biden campaign announced this week that Mr Emhoff would be leaving DLA Piper, ""to develop the portfolio he will focus on to support the work of the administration"".  Mr Emhoff is the fourth husband of an American presidential or vice-presidential candidate - following the husbands of Geraldine Ferraro, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton.   But he is the first and only to make it to the White House - a position so new that it does not yet seem to have an official name. ""No one has told me! I don't know,"" he said to Marie Claire in October.  Held only by women, ""this role has been very gendered"", said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.  It's also largely ceremonial. Previous first and second ladies have typically adopted uncontroversial agendas, complementary to their husbands' administrations. While George Bush pushed education policy, Laura Bush advocated for children's literacy. Barack Obama championed health care, and Michelle Obama promoted exercise and healthy eating.  Second ladies receive even less attention - Jill Biden focused on military families and education during her tenure - but Ms Harris's historic and high-profile candidacy will bring notice to her husband. As vice-president, Ms Harris will preside over the Senate, leaving Mr Emhoff in charge of convening lunches and events for the senators' spouses.  Having Mr Emhoff take on what has been an exclusively female role, ""is the first step towards true equality for political spouses,"" Ms Perry said. ""We're unused to having men give up their careers for their wives, spouses and families,"" she added, citing global studies that show the brunt of domestic work still falling on women.  Asked if Mr Emhoff was aware of the discussions regarding gender roles, Mr Jacoby laughed.  ""Everybody is aware of it,"" he said. ""It doesn't really matter. He will be engaging, and fun and social, at the same time he will get a concrete result at whatever the goodwill building assignment is.""   In terms of his actual focus, criminal justice reform is a likely candidate, reflective of the second couple's interests and careers. But both Mr Jacoby and Mr Weingarten insisted that their friend's primary focus would be on the vice-president.  ""Doug is in this to support Kamala,"" ""There's obviously some novelty... that Doug is the first dude,"" Mr Weingarten said, adding that Mr Emhoff would be an ""exceptional role model"".  But, he said, ""the story is that [Kamala] is going to be vice-president"".   The fanfare and media attention attached to Mr Emhoff may be largely because of the novelty of the male political spouse. But it may also point to a lag in gender equality. Second ladies have rarely received the same volume of applause before even starting their new jobs.  Some first ladies have been embraced and adored by the American public. Michelle Obama, for example, often received better popularity ratings than her husband and later sold out arenas on a global book tour. But first and second ladies abandoning their careers to becoming full-time political spouses - like Mr Emhoff - has mostly been taken for granted.  ""We're giving him extra credit for what women have done for centuries,"" Ms Perry said.  She's still optimistic about Mr Emhoff, however, and his potential for challenging gender norms.  ""There would have been very traditional macho men who would not have wanted to be that supportive,"" she said. And maybe we don't hear about their wives advancing like Ms Harris, Ms Perry said, because they lack the same support from their spouses.  ""I would make Douglas Emhoff an honorary woman,"" she said. ""I hope he would take that as the compliment that it's meant to be."" ",2020-11-13T23:13:16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54899230,2020-11-14 11:12:10.061457,BBC,politics,0
Coronavirus: Five signs that show how bad El Paso's outbreak is,"The US had just over nine million Covid-19 cases when November began - now, just weeks later, the country is topping 11 million. And one west Texas county has emerged as the latest American epicentre. Right on the border with Mexico, El Paso in Texas is known for its desert landscape, military complexes and plentiful sunshine. Now, it's making a name as one of the worst hit regions in the nation. Covid-19 patients account for more than half of all hospital admissions in the county of El Paso, and the case count continues to trend upwards.  Here are five symptoms of the unfolding crisis. With cases going up by more than a thousand every day in El Paso, some 76,000 people have now been infected. That's about the same number of confirmed cases as in the whole of Greece or Libya. Data shows 1,120 El Paso residents are currently in hospital with the virus, and this number is expected to rise. That means that of all the Covid patients in hospital across the state of Texas, one in six is in El Paso, according to the latest figures. A total of 782 people are known to have died.  Both hospitals and staff are struggling to cope. An El Paso University Medical Center spokesman said the hospital recognised the ""physical and emotional"" toll the pandemic was taking on healthcare workers.  As officials race to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of sick people, El Paso city's convention centre was recently converted into a makeshift hospital to provide extra beds. Some facilities are so overrun that patients are being airlifted to other cities in the state. On Monday, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said the county had opened 500 extra hospital beds so far, but at the rate the virus was spreading, those beds would be full by next week. As hospitals grapple with too many patients, El Paso's morgue has been unable to keep up with the county's rising death toll. As a result, officials are turning to refrigerated trailers. Ten of these mobile morgues have been requested in recent weeks. The mobile facilities are set up outside the county's medical examiner's office, which has been handling more than 150 bodies in the last week.  Earlier this month, the US defence department deployed medical teams to assist local health workers. Even the county's funeral homes are feeling the strain. One manager, Jorge Ortiz, told KERA News he has had to convert the home's chapel into a makeshift cooler. Mr Ortiz said the peak back in the summer is ""nothing compared to what we're living right now"". The city continues to face a shortage of staff, and officials have faced criticism for turning to local prisons for help. Inmates have been pictured handling the bodies of Covid victims at the medical examiner's office, helping load them into the mobile morgues.  A sheriff's office spokesman said the inmates - who are minor offenders in minimum security prisons - are being compensated $2 (Â£1.5) an hour. The work is voluntary and they are being provided with protective gear, but the move has still shocked many. County Judge Samaniego called using inmates a last resort.  ""If there's no personnel, no one to help out, and there's volunteers, even if they are inmates, then that's what we're left with,"" he said, according to KFOX14 News. The judge added that officials were waiting for Texas National Guardsmen to help with the efforts - but the military hasn't confirmed that they could handle the demand. In the last six months, one El Paso woman has lost six of her family members to the virus as the outbreak worsens. Bonnie Soria Najera told Good Morning America that her uncle was the last to pass away on Sunday. She has also had to bury her parents, two aunts and a cousin. ""They were all being very careful,"" she said. ""They did things that they had to do: grocery stores, went to doctor's appointments."" Ms Najera's mother first tested positive in May. Within three days, her mother was on a ventilator, she said. Her father soon fell ill with the virus too, but ended up at a different hospital. A week after her mother was admitted, she passed away. An hour later, Ms Najera learned her father was on a ventilator. He would pass away three weeks later. Ms Najera too, came down with Covid-19, but eventually recovered. As she began feeling better, she learned her cousin and her aunt had both died after contracting the virus. And last week, another aunt also passed away in hospital from Covid-19. Now, Ms Najera is calling for Texans to practise social distancing properly, like her family tried to. ""You don't want to be in our shoes,"" she said. Despite the worries of many El Pasoans, there's no lockdown in sight for the west Texas county.  On Friday, a state appeals court overturned a stay-at-home order after local restaurant owners and the state attorney general sued Judge Samaniego for shutting down the city. A panel of judges ruled 2-1 that the order to close nonessential businesses until December went against the Texas governor's 7 October reopening guidance. Some businesses resumed operations almost immediately, local media reported. Attorney General Ken Paxton called Judge Samaniego a ""tyrant"" over the mandate. The county judge responded that it was ""unfortunate"" that the attorney general sought ""to gloat instead of coming to El Paso to walk along side me by the mobile morgues"". Judge Samaniego added he was disappointed by the decision, but noted that El Pasoans must still adhere to certain restrictions on masks, businesses and gatherings.",2020-11-17T21:42:15,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54966876,2020-11-18 08:23:30.539724,BBC,politics,0
"Covid: The new lockdown rules for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland","Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, with new rules for everything from meeting friends to going to the shops. The nations are able to set their own rules, so the measures in place vary. Northern Ireland's restrictions will now last until midnight on 26 November. Schools closed for a two-week extended half-term break but have now reopened. Current measures include: From Friday 20 November: Wales has completed its lockdown, in which people were told to stay at home, extended households were scrapped for most, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops were closed.  Under the new regulations: First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to reduce the number of people they see and the time spent with them, to reduce the risk of catching or spreading the virus. The current lockdown is due to last until 2 December. Staying at home and seeing people Going to work or school Exercise What about shops, pubs and other venues? What about worship, weddings and funerals? Can I still move house?  Each area of Scotland has now moved into one of five levels: More than half of Scotland's 32 local authorities are under level three restrictions, including Edinburgh and Glasgow. All the rest are starting off on levels one or two. Schools will stay open in all levels. The decision is based on factors including number of cases per 100,000 people, the ratio of positive test results, projections of new cases and the capacity of local hospitals and intensive care units.

"Working from home could lead to more prejudice, report warns","By Harry Farley & Will DahlgreenBBC News Widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, a new report warns. Workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions, the England and Wales study for the Woolf Institute suggests.  Institute founder Ed Kessler said as more people work from home they risk going ""back into isolated silos"".  He called on ministers to focus on offices and workplaces as a ""vital"" area for improving community relations.  The study, conducted by polling company Survation for the Woolf Institute, which researches interfaith relations, surveyed 11,701 people.  Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together. Samuel said that while he had never had racist or Islamophobic views in the past, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities.  ""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he said. Hadiya agreed saying that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine"". But through their work they have become close friends. ""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" Hadiya said. ""We were both from very different backgrounds and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other."" Samuel added: ""Before Covid we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities, and areas of agreement and disagreement. ""Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss."" The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) - regardless of ethnicity - were in a setting that is ethnically diverse. However, it suggests that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group. And it warns that without alternative settings to offices being set up, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced.  The study also examined people's opinions on diversity.  Its findings suggest that while nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), less than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person.  ""The word 'Muslim' appears to trigger more negative sentiment than the word 'Pakistani',"" the report says. This is ""despite the fact that 90% of people of British Pakistani heritage are Muslim"". The study estimated the level of prejudice in each local authority across England and Wales. Researchers used a technique known as Multilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP), which looks at the survey responses and the demographics of each area. As well as being the most common target of negative attitudes by other faith groups, the report indicates Muslims are the group most likely to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions. The study also suggests that diversity of friendships and colleagues varies significantly around the country. Even after accounting for factors such as the age, educational attainment and ethnic makeup of an area, people in north-east England are 150% more likely to have only British friends and 68% more likely to have only British colleagues, compared with people in London. The report says any apparent prejudice toward religion could be due to people feeling it is more acceptable to express negative sentiment towards religion than ethnicity. Religion remains ""a place where individuals are willing to express negative attitudes,"" the report says. ""Being Muslim, in particular, appears to remain a 'trigger' for prejudice, making religion a 'final frontier' for prejudice in England and Wales,"" the report's author Dr Julian Hargreaves added.  Methodology The survey was undertaken by Survation on behalf of the Woolf Institute. Survation spoke to a nationally representative sample of 11,701 adults across England and Wales between 29 March and 5 April 2019. The results indicating the proportion of people in each local authority who would be happy with a friend or close relative marrying someone from various backgrounds use a technique called Multilevel Regression Poststratification (MRP).  MRP projects the results of the survey onto local authorities based on the demography of the area. However, some estimates contain wide margins of error and statistically non-significant differences between local authorities.",2020-11-16T01:45:24,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54937713,2020-11-16 08:08:04.170882,BBC,world,0
How do I find a new job during Covid and which sectors are hiring?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News It's a tough time in the jobs market, as firms shed staff or freeze recruitment to cut costs. UK unemployment grew to 4.8% in the three months to September, while redundancies rose to a record high. But online job vacancies are now being posted at 70% of last year's average, the highest since the pandemic hit. In the week to 30 October, the volume of online job adverts posted was at 70% of the 2019 average, the highest since the end of March. Some sectors have recovered more strongly than others. Health and social care vacancies are now above 2019 levels, data suggests, while funding has begun for hundreds of nurse apprenticeships in England. By contrast, the rate of catering and hospitality vacancies is down two-thirds on last year's average, suggesting ""the recovery has stalled"" in this sector, the Office for National Statistics says. Jobseekers should be ''strategic'' and target sectors experiencing job shortages as well as those that are growing, says Gerwyn Davies, analyst at human resources body the CIPD.  The shortage occupation list - used to offer work visas to people moving to the UK -  quickly shows where workers are needed, and includes fields like engineering, web programming and graphic design. Now could be a good time to join the public sector, he suggests, with initiatives like the national retraining scheme helping people move into areas like social work, teaching and healthcare. Tech recruiter Amy Golding suggests applying to companies which are fully digital, regardless of the role you want, as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online working. These could be online retail companies like Amazon, which is recruiting for 7,000 UK jobs by the end of 2020 - or tech companies working in education or healthcare.   To maximise your chances, one strategy is to create an appealing online profile so that recruiters and companies will approach you, while you also actively apply for jobs. Consider your core skills, rather than hunting for a specific job title, suggests Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management. For example, if you work in retail customer service, this could translate to other people-facing roles such as sales. She suggests searching for these core skills online, to see which jobs come up, while also listing them on your professional profiles. Recruiters often search for people based on a list of desired skills, so this will make you more visible. Many companies list jobs on their own website or on recruitment sites. You can also sign up with a general or specialist recruitment agency.  If you want to work for a particular company, check if they hire directly or through a recruiter.  And if you want a specific job, be proactive and contact someone doing that role to discover how they got there. Professional networks can also be useful. These could be LinkedIn or Facebook groups, or industry organisations, where jobs and events are posted and advice is available. Some industries and employers have even set up virtual networking events and job fairs. With thousands of people applying for some roles, your personal network should be your first port of call, Corinne suggests. Friends, family and acquaintances will collectively know hundreds of people, and some should know of businesses which are hiring.  Many employers like a personal recommendation and you may hear about roles before they are advertised. When compiling your CV, emphasise your skills which a prospective employer wants, rather than listing things you have already done. List past achievements clearly. For example, you finished a recent project on time and within budget, or brought in new clients.  Asking someone else to read your application helps spot any spelling or grammatical errors that could mean your CV goes straight in the bin.  Show enthusiasm and give reasons why you want to work for this employer specifically. Tailor your CV and cover letter for each application, which is time-consuming but more likely to result in a job, suggests Amy Golding.  She adds: ''If you don't hear back within three days, call them - because that makes it harder for them to ignore you!'' The national careers service offers many tools. These include a skills assessment, a search tool for courses, and help with CVs. The government's ''find a job'' website also lists vacancies. Gaining new skills could help you move into a new sector and shows employers you've been productive during lockdown. Many universities and other institutions are currently offering free training courses.  For example, the University of Edinburgh is offering free short courses in fields such as Data Ethics and AI, the University of Oxford has a free course on economic development, and the Open University offers many free courses too.  Many other platforms, such as Codeacademy and Coursera, offer online coding tutorial, some of which are free. The Prince's Trust is offering free personal development sessions to help 18-30 year-olds get into the health and social care sector. The charity offers mentoring, CV help, and can match jobseekers with suitable local employers.",2020-11-11T16:49:13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53685650,2020-11-13 14:40:06.541957,BBC,technology,0
Taylor Swift master tapes sold by Scooter Braun to investment fund,"US singer Taylor Swift has confirmed a report that music mogul Scooter Braun has sold the rights to her first six albums.  US entertainment magazine Variety first reported on Monday that Braun had sold the rights - known as masters - to an investment fund. It said the deal is thought to be worth more than $300 million (Â£227m). Writing on Twitter Swift said it was ""the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge"".  It is the latest development in the dispute between Swift and Braun - Swift has previously accused Braun of trying to ""dismantle"" her musical legacy.  There has been no initial response from Braun to the Variety report or Swift's remarks. The BBC has sent an email to Braun for comment. Swift signed a deal with record label Big Machine in 2004 granting them ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums in exchange for a cash advance to kick-start her career. In the music industry, ownership of masters means you control what can be done with a song or album, such as whether it is used in an advert or on a streaming platform. Owners of popular songs can earn a huge amount of money.  Braun bought Big Machine in June 2019, and with it the rights to most of Swift's work. Since then the pair have been locked in a major battle over control of the music.  In her statement, Swift said she had been ""actively trying to regain ownership of my master recordings"" over the last year and had tried to enter talks with Braun.  She said Braun's legal team wanted her to sign a non-disclosure agreement stating ""I would never say another word about Scooter Braun unless it was positive"".  Been getting a lot of questions about the recent sale of my old masters. I hope this clears things up. pic.twitter.com/sscKXp2ibD Then just a few weeks ago, Swift wrote, she was contacted by private equity company Shamrock Holdings who said they had bought her music and album art from Braun. While she was ""open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock"", she learnt that under the terms Braun ""will continue to profit off my old music"" for years. ""I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,"" she wrote in a letter she sent to the company, which she included in her tweet.  She also said she has begun re-recording some of her older music and thanked her fans for their support. ""I love you guys and I'm just gonna keep cruising, as they say,"" she wrote. Swift and Braun have had a poor relationship for years. When his company, Ithaca Holdings, paid $300m to acquire Swift's former record label last year, Swift saw it as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". She accused Braun - who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato - of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". But Braun last year told Variety Magazine that the dispute had ""gotten out of hand"" after he and his family received death threats.  ""I think there are a lot of real problems in the world, and I think that these problems that are being discussed can be discussed behind closed doors and figured out pretty easily, and it's something I've wanted to do for six months,"" he told the magazine.",2020-11-17T01:26:44,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54969396,2020-11-17 09:53:11.375390,BBC,entertainment,0
Dominic Cummings leaves Downing Street: Top aide's career highlights,"By Alice EvansBBC News He's spent nearly two decades working with Conservative politicians in the upper reaches of government - but many of us hadn't heard of Dominic Cummings until his infamous lockdown trip to Barnard Castle earlier this year. Now that the prime minister's chief adviser is leaving Downing Street, we look back at some memorable moments in his career. Mr Cummings became a household name after he defended his 260-mile drive from his home in London to his parents' farm in County Durham during the UK's national coronavirus lockdown in March.  Following pressure from all political sides to explain why he went against the government's ""stay at home"" messaging, Mr Cummings said he made the journey for childcare reasons after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms.  But a subsequent outing, this time from the cottage on his parents' farm to the historic market town of Barnard Castle, was the trip that gave fuel to meme-makers across the country. Mr Cummings said the reason for that trip was to test his eyesight and his readiness to drive back to London.  The success of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum no doubt helped to secure Mr Cummings' job in Downing Street, as it was his role during that which cemented his strong bond with Boris Johnson. Mr Cummings, the campaign's director, was credited with the ""take back control"" slogan that appeared to strike a chord with so many referendum voters, as well as the claim that Britain could save Â£350m a week by leaving the EU. In addition to his snappy slogans, Mr Cummings has also hurled some infamous insults at politicians - often through the medium of his personal blog. For example, he has said: Mr Cummings' blog also drew headlines when he used it to tout his ideas to shake up the civil service. In a blog post in January this year, he said the civil service lacked people with ""deep expertise in specific fields"" and called for ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to get in touch with him via a private Gmail address if they wanted to work in government.  The post stoked tensions, with the civil servants' union saying staff were recruited on merit and ""because of what you can do, not what you believe"". The clashes with other civil servants reached new heights after a special adviser was sacked and escorted out of Downing Street by police, following a confrontation with Mr Cummings.  No reason was given for Sonia Khan's dismissal in August 2019, but it's thought she had been accused by Mr Cummings of leaking details of a no-deal Brexit exercise to the media. Her then-boss (and then-chancellor) Sajid Javid ""voiced his anger"" with the PM over her treatment, later resigning when Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides. Labour said Mr Javid's departure showed Mr Cummings had ""won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury"". This is perhaps a lesser-known highlight, but it's a highlight all the same.  According to Buzzfeed News, Mr Cummings was greatly frustrated by the prime minister's rejection of his proposal to change Downing Street's office layout. The top aide wanted to knock walls through and put desks in circles around both him and Mr Johnson, who would sit in the centre, the Buzzfeed report claims. The news site claims the plans were rejected as unworkable - in part as a result of No 10's status as a Grade One listed building. The penny must drop that you've had an interesting career when you hear an Oscar-nominated actor is preparing to play you in a TV drama. Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Mr Cummings in Channel 4's Brexit: The Uncivil War was as - in the words of our arts editor - ""an intense, socially awkward, strategic mastermind with a gentle Durham accent and a penchant for hanging out in stationery cupboards at work"".",2020-11-13T22:26:47,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54938079,2020-11-14 11:09:26.323794,BBC,politics,0
"Brexit: Trade deal sticking points 'can be resolved', says UK minister","Sticking points over a post-Brexit trade agreement between the UK and EU ""can be resolved"" and a deal ""can be done"", says a government minister.  Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""agreement exists"" between the two sides. But earlier, he told Sky News there was still ""some way between us"" and ""time is very, very short"" to agree a deal. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said talks have ""got to make big progress"" in the coming week.  He told Sky's Sophy Ridge getting a trade agreement was ""difficult but also very doable"", and the consequences of failing to would be ""significant"".  The talks between the UK and EU are due to resume on Monday in Brussels.  The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost, has arrived in the city, tweeting that there had been ""some progress in a positive direction in recent days"". But he said ""significant elements"" of the deal are yet to be agreed, adding: ""We may not succeed."" Any deal between the UK and EU would need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, so time is running out for an agreement to be reached and to get the sign off before 31 December.  The UK left the EU on 31 January, but continues to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year while negotiations take place. If there is no agreement at that point, trade between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules - with tariffs set to be introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs. Mr Eustice said there would be ""some impact"" in this situation, because of tariffs, but added most would be ""quite modest"". However, he conceded products such as lamb being sold into the EU could face taxes of more than 40%. The environment secretary told Andrew Marr: ""We do want to get a free trade agreement with the European Union and an agreement could be done. ""We are not asking for anything remarkable. We are asking for an agreement akin to the one they have with Canada. ""We are asking for something that has got a precedent."" The main sticking points between the two sides are over competition rules - where governments give state aid support to businesses - and on fishing rights.  Mr Coveney said the conversation over fishing had become ""very emotive"" and both sides needed to ""dial down the language"", or the deal could collapse over the issue.  He added: ""If a deal isn't done this week we have real problems. We are running out of time now.""",2020-11-15T11:36:11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54950011,2020-11-15 16:12:21.722553,BBC,politics,0
Lord Feldman: Department of Health adviser's firm took work from Covid company,"By Phil KempBBC News A public relations firm whose managing partner previously advised ministers on Covid is providing consultancy for a testing company signed up by government.  Lord Feldman's PR firm began advising Oxford Nanopore after it struck a Â£28m deal with the Department of Health. He insists he had no involvement in the award of the contract. The Department of Health said it drew on the expertise of private sector partners to help in its Covid response. On 29 October many Westminster journalists were preoccupied with the release of a significant report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Some would have missed the publication of dozens of documents on the Cabinet Office website, done under rules designed to make the government more transparent with the public about its spending and conduct. Among the documents was a list of meetings health ministers had held at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. These reveal that on 1 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock met with Oxford Nanopore, a company which makes Covid-19 tests, and Lord Feldman, the former Conservative party chairman. At the time, Lord Feldman was acting for the government, which had employed him as an unpaid adviser on Covid. He was also a managing partner with the lobbying firm Tulchan Communications. By the date of his next meeting with Oxford Nanopore, six weeks later, the testing firm had agreed a Â£27.9m contract with Mr Hancock's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). This was to supply Covid testing kits, reagents (chemicals needed for testing), training material and support. The firm went on to win a further contract worth more than Â£100m with the department, to supply rapid Covid tests. It has now been confirmed to the BBC, by Tulchan, that it is employed by Oxford Nanopore to do ""PR and public affairs"" for the company. Lobbying rules require companies, such as Tulchan, to disclose publicly any communication they have with ministers or permanent secretaries on behalf of paying clients. BBC News asked the firm whether Lord Feldman had been advising the government when Tulchan was working with Oxford Nanopore, and whether that conflict of interest had been disclosed. Tulchan said that it began an ""advisory role"" with the biotech firm to provide ""communications advice"" on 25 June, a month after Lord Feldman had ceased working as a government adviser, on 15 May.

It added that Oxford Nanopore had already been discussing providing Covid testing solutions to the government before Lord Feldman's meeting with them in April. But the revelations have prompted questions from the opposition. ""This latest story follows a string of troubling incidents where a select group have been given privileged access to the government,"" said Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister. ""The country deserves to have confidence their money is being spent effectively by the government - and to know without doubt that friends and donors to the Conservative Party aren't profiting from this pandemic."" Earlier this month the Sunday Times alleged that one lobbyist, who had worked on NHS Test and Trace, went on to share information with clients. The Labour Party has called for an inquiry into whether lobbyists employed by the government during the Covid response benefited from privileged information. The DHSC said it had ""rightly... drawn on the expertise of a number of private sector partners who provided advice and expertise to assist in the Government's vital work"". ""As a result of the public and private sectors working together at pace, we were able to strengthen our response to the pandemic so we are better prepared for the challenges of the coming months.""

Covid: Romania's 'hero' doctor taken to Belgium for treatment for severe burns,"A Romanian doctor who suffered severe burns after trying to save Covid-19 patients from a hospital fire has been taken to Belgium for treatment. Dr Catalin Denciu was called ""heroic"" by PM Ludovic Orban, who praised his ""particular courage and spirit of sacrifice"" trying to save the patients. Ten patients died in the blaze at the hospital in Piatra Neamt on Saturday. An inquiry has been launched into how the deadly fire broke out in the public hospital's intensive care unit. The fire also spread to an adjoining room. Some reports suggest a medical appliance caught fire, igniting a nearby oxygen cylinder. Regional officials say the unit was moved from the third floor of the hospital to the second without official notification. Seven men and three women, aged between 67 and 86, died in the fire. Six other Covid-19 patients injured in the fire were transferred to another hospital in the city of Iasi. Dr Denciu was transferred to Belgium's Queen Astrid military hospital, having been taken to the capital Bucharest after suffering second to third degree burns to 40% of his body, officials said. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called it a ""huge tragedy"" and said it was important to find out what had happened ""in order to avoid similar situations in future"". Romania has reported more than 360,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and nearly 9,000 deaths.  Nearly 13,000 Covid-19 patients were in hospital across Romania as of Sunday, including 1,169 in intensive care units, Reuters news agency reports.",2020-11-16T04:04:23,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54955089,2020-11-16 08:06:21.376121,BBC,politics,0
Coronavirus: Doctors spell out how to exit England's lockdown,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Lifting lockdown must be handled better this time round to avoid a surge in Covid that could overwhelm the NHS, doctors say.  The British Medical Association has published a blueprint for how it thinks England should proceed with any easing.  It includes replacing the ""rule of six"" with a two-households restriction to reduce social mixing and banning travel between different local lockdown tiers.  Government has yet to say if or exactly how England will exit on 2 December.  It will decide next week, based on whether cases have fallen enough and how much strain hospitals are under.  Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said ministers want to see a ""significant easing"" of coronavirus controls. But Public Health England medical director and NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser Susan Hopkins said the government would have to look at ""strengthening"" the three-tier system introduced in October.  And now, the BMA, a trade union for UK doctors, has said robust measures to keep the virus under control must be in place before lockdown ends, including: BMA chair of council Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the government must learn from mistakes from the ending of the first lockdown - rapid relaxation and inadequate monitoring, while people had been encouraged to go to the pub and dine out. ""It is unthinkable that we make the same mistakes again,"" he said, ""because this time, the impact will be far worse.""  Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the original lockdown in March, has said reopening pubs and restaurants in the run-up to Christmas would likely lead to rising infection levels. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""The big question in practical terms is can we reopen hospitality venues - pubs and restaurants - in the run-up to Christmas and still avoid infection levels increasing? ""I suspect we can't, but the decision may be made to do so anyhow on the basis that any increase will be slow and may be able to be counteracted later."" The NHS was preparing to roll out Covid vaccinations should a jab become available soon, the BMA said. But such a mass immunisation programme must be properly resourced and funded by government. And all of that groundwork should be done now, rather than later.  The Department of Health and Social Care said it has invested over Â£230m into manufacturing any successful vaccine and there had been ""an enormous amount of planning and preparation"" for distributing it to the people who needed it.

Strictly Come Dancing: Anton Du Beke to replace Motsi Mabuse this weekend,"Anton Du Beke is to join the judging panel on Strictly Come Dancing this weekend. The announcement comes after Motsi Mabuse said she would be self-isolating after a trip to Germany. She had originally intended to join the show digitally this weekend, and judge the contestants from home. However, the BBC has now confirmed Du Beke will replace her on the judging panel.  That means this weekend's judges will be Du Beke, Craig Revel Horwood and head judge Shirley Ballas. ""We are pleased to announce that the King of Ballroom Anton Du Beke is stepping into our judging panel this weekend,"" Strictly said in a statement on Twitter. Du Beke's temporary appointment comes after he was eliminated from the competition in the first week of this series. He had been partnered with former home secretary Jacqui Smith. Earlier this week, Nicola Adams and Katya Jones had to pull out of this series after Jones tested positive for coronavirus. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

How Germany remembers the world wars,"The Prince of Wales is visiting Berlin on Sunday to participate in Germany's National Day of Mourning. The wreath-laying ceremony - in the year marking the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two - takes place in a building that symbolises the country's fraught relationship with the memory of war, writes Chris Bowlby. Whereas Remembrance Day in Britain prompts a united sense of national pride in military service, and respect for the sacrifices of those who fought in both world wars, Germany's commemoration of the war dead is much more cautious and complex.  Military service in 20th Century Germany is associated with profound shame - focused above all on the victims of Nazi military aggression and the Holocaust. Reinforcing that is a belief that the ground for Germany's Nazi catastrophe was laid by the militarism of the Prussian state that unified the country in the 19th Century and led it into World War One.  It was this militaristic state that built the Neue Wache or ""new guardhouse"", a classical building on the famous central Berlin street of Unter den Linden, which is now at the heart of the annual day of mourning.  Built in 1818, it was originally intended to celebrate the success of war in building national identity by liberating Germany from Napoleonic rule. And later military triumphs - especially over France in 1871 - were crucial landmarks as Prussia and Germany became a great European power. The Neue Wache was both a place to remember victories and generals and a centre of the famous Prussian military machine. It was from there that mobilisation for WW1 was declared in 1914.  Like other participants in that war, Germany suffered huge casualties. An annual day of national mourning - the Volkstrauertag - was first held in the 1920s. And there was discussion about creating a place of national memory similar to the Cenotaph in London. But the re-opening of the Neue Wache as a ""Memorial Site for the Fallen of the World War"" in 1931 revealed sharp divisions within German society.  Those on the left wanted the memorial to express pacifist sympathy for the victims of war. Others - including the rapidly growing Nazi movement - insisted it should continue to celebrate military triumph. After the Nazis took power in 1933 they replaced the day of mourning with a day of commemoration of heroes, the Heldengedenktag. The Neue Wache was now used for their glorification of war - an echo of Prussian militarism in a new fascist style. Twelve years later, the Third Reich's military aggression had led to a catastrophic defeat, and with the Neue Wache now located in Soviet-occupied Germany, what became the communist GDR was faced with a decision about how to use the building. On the one hand it was described as a memorial to the ""victims of fascism"" - a fascism the communists claimed they were solely responsible for defeating. But even though the GDR was a Soviet puppet state its leaders were keen to establish their own links with a deeper German history, including its military tradition. And so, bizarrely, when I first saw the Neue Wache in the early 1980s, GDR soldiers stood outside in uniforms similar to older German army uniforms, and even goose-stepped when changing the guard, a disturbing sight to those with memories of goose-stepping German armies of the past. After the GDR collapsed in 1989 and Germany reunified, the Neue Wache was changed once again, finally taking on the form and purpose that it has today. This time the focus was on a sculpture from the 1930s by the artist KÃ¤the Kollwitz installed in one of the building's chambers, depicting a woman holding a dead child.    Her sculpture was seen as finally turning attention away from military memory towards all the victims of war and tyranny. That is the spirit of the ceremony and modern day of mourning in which the Prince of Wales is participating. Speaking at the Neue Wache earlier this year, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the end of WW2 marked ""the end of National Socialist tyranny, the end of night bombings and death marches, the end of unprecedented German crimes and the Holocaust's breach of civilisation"". Kollwitz's sculpture is meant to represent not only a mother's grief at the loss of her soldier son but also all those non-soldiers caught up in the horrors of war - especially Holocaust victims but also less well-known sufferers, such as the German women who suffered mass sexual violence at the end of WW2.  Modern debate about the Neue Wache has also involved another question - whether as part of the restoration of Berlin's Prussia-era architecture, its statues of famous generals should be restored to their original positions in or near the building. And that is part of a larger problem. Where does modern emphasis on remembering the victims of war leave the memory and reputation of those who served in the German armed forces? There can be no doubting the scale of grief felt by many millions of German families who lost fathers, brothers or sons in the world wars. Kollwitz lost two sons in WW1 and wrote movingly of her own bitter regret at having allowed her sons to enlist in the patriotic fervour of 1914.  ""Wrote a farewell letter to Peter,"" she recorded. ""As if the child is being cut off the umbilical cord for the second time. The first time to live, the second time to die."" He was killed a few days later. The figure in her sculpture in the Neue Wache, said Kollwitz, represented ""an old, lonely and darkly reflecting woman"".  Remembering soldiers lost in WW2 has been especially sensitive. Werner KrÃ¤tschell, a Protestant pastor in Berlin, told me that ""the wounds of the Second World War are very vivid until today,"" as children were left without fathers, wives without husbands.  And yet much of this grief had to remain private. These lost soldiers could not be commemorated in public as heroes, as the German military were more and more associated with the brutal conquests and war crimes committed by the Nazi regime.  The very idea of an army and military service was highly controversial in post-war West Germany. After Nazism was defeated the Western allies initially banned the country from having an army. They relented in the 1950s under Cold War pressures. But the new Bundeswehr was intended to be ""citizens in uniform"", as different as possible from previous German armies, over which a veil was often drawn.  When I first visited Germany on a school exchange in the 1970s, the father of the family I was staying with talked readily about older military history, and proudly took me to the huge memorial near Detmold commemorating the massacre in the Teutoburger forest of Roman legions by German tribes. He was much more reticent about his own service in WW2. War commemoration was diplomatically sensitive too.  The West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl began tentatively in the 1980s to try and draw other world leaders into shared commemoration of German military casualties. But that backfired in 1985 when a cemetery he had invited US President Ronald Reagan to visit in Bitburg turned out to contain the graves of elite SS Nazi troops.  It was widely claimed that Nazi war crimes had been committed by the SS and other elite units, while the mainstream Wehrmacht army had - like most of the German population - remained ignorant of and uninvolved in the Holocaust. ""The image of the patriotic Wehrmacht,"" argues the historian Mary Fulbrook, ""persisted for several decades, providing succour to those who had lost loved ones at the front."" But then a 1990s travelling exhibition called The Crimes of the Wehrmacht showed how the army had often been complicit in atrocities. This challenged the myth of the ""clean Wehrmacht"" says Fulbrook, and ""forced a shift in conversations, with young people now interrogating their grandparents in new ways."" The awkwardness of such family conversations is what can make German commemoration of war still so difficult. And broader hostility towards the military in general remains strong. Today's Germany has tiptoed only very slowly towards becoming a more ""normal"" military power, with the Bundeswehr deployed abroad. Pastor Werner KrÃ¤tschell is descended from a distinguished Prussian family of clerics and cavalry officers. But ""because of our guilt"" he told me, ""there is in every German a deep unconscious knowledge of this bad side combined with uniforms, weapons, army, brutality and war"". The private or small-scale remembrance of the millions of soldiers lost in war is still intense. War graves are central to this, with cemeteries in communities small and large hinting at the scale of the loss. The charity responsible for German war graves, the Volksbund, founded in 1919, still organises many of Germany's commemorations of the war dead including the national day of mourning. Since the end of the Cold War its work has also included the highly sensitive task of recovering soldiers' remains and maintaining German military cemeteries in parts of Central and Eastern Europe where the most terrible Nazi crimes were committed. The Volksbund stresses what it sees as its educational role. ""The vast burial grounds are a reminder of the past that also confront the living with the consequences of war and violence,"" it says. And that idea, in the end, strongly shapes German remembrance of war. Individual grief at the loss of family members, including millions of soldiers, is real enough. But the memory of the vast numbers of other victims of Germany's wars will always be present too.   The events of D-Day are often recounted by Allied troops who took part in the invasion. But what was it like for a German soldier surprised by the sudden - and completely unexpected - arrival of the enemy?

"Yes Sir, I Can Boogie: Why disco hit is now Scotland's unofficial anthem","A 1970s disco classic has become Scotland's unofficial national anthem after a video of ecstatic players dancing to the tune went viral. The footage showed the victorious squad bouncing in the dressing room to Yes Sir, I Can Boogie after defeating Serbia on penalties. The song by Spanish duo Baccara spent a single week at the top of the UK charts in 1977. It was originally adopted by fans as a tribute to defender Andrew Considine.  The Aberdeen cult hero - who was called up to the Scotland team for the first time earlier this year at the age of 33 - famously starred in a spoof video of the song on his stag do. The player was unrecognisable as he dressed in drag to strut his stuff to the tune alongside friends and his father, with the professionally-produced video being played on his wedding day in 2015.  Considine was an unused substitute for Thursday night's historic match, which saw the Scottish men's team dramatically end 22 years of hurt by clinching a place at the European Championships. But a video tweeted by the Scotland National Team after the match showed him in the thick of the action as he boogie-woogied with team mates including Kieran Tierney, Scott McTominay, Leigh Griffiths and Callum McGregor.  ð¶ Oh, yes sir... ð¶#NoScotlandNoParty pic.twitter.com/UNTLXIuHVH The video immediately caught the imagination of the Tartan Army, with jubilant fans starting a campaign to get the song back to Number One in the charts. Not all the team's heroes had been able to get involved, with midfielders John McGinn and Ryan Christie - who scored Scotland's goal in the match - having to take routine drug tests while the party was kicking off in the dressing room.  Don't worry guys... it's a boogie, boogie woogie all night long.#NoScotlandNoParty https://t.co/MgjjlRZlr3 Luckily for McGinn and Christie, the boogie-woogieing did indeed continue well into the night - with fresh footage of celebrations at what appears to be the team hotel in Belgrade being tweeted on Friday morning. This time the soundtrack of choice was Saturday Night by Whigfield - with goalkeeper David Marshall leading a conga around the room as teammates chanted his name to the 90s hit.  Marshall had earlier written himself into Scottish football folklore by saving Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty to clinch victory in the shootout.

Africa basks in Booker boost for female writers,"By Molara WoodNigeria Two African women are in the running for the 2020 Booker Prize, in a historic first for the UK's most prestigious literary prize - and a major boost for storytellers on the continent. News that Ethiopian-American Maaza Mengiste, author of The Shadow King, and Zimbabwean Tsitsi Dangarembga, with her novel This Mournable Body, were on the shortlist for the Â£50,000 ($66,000) award was received with celebration on the African literary scene. ""The fact that there are two Africans, there are three black people on this list, feels like this is a clarion call to the industry that it is possible to judge something fairly, not fall into tokenism, to judge a work for what it is. It feels like it sets a new path for the competitions,"" Maaza said after the announcement that she was on the shortlist of six. ""I have often been the only African, the only black person, on a list; and this time it seems like the judges have thrown down a gauntlet and said that they will judge a book by what's actually written, and not on the reputation of a writer or the reputation of the power they might have on the industry."" Maaza and Dangarembga have both participated at perhaps the largest literary festival in Africa, the Ake Festival in Nigeria, which is a major draw for young writers and cash-strapped African publishers who no doubt wonder if they will ever make a breakthrough.  Dangarembga was a headliner at Ake in 2019 and during my onstage conversation with her, the audience was shocked to learn that the Zimbabwean author has had her fair share of literary adversity, despite the starry heights attained by her debut novel, Nervous Conditions.  Published in 1988, the novel won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Africa the following year and was named one of Africa's Best Books of the 20th Century, and made the BBC list of The 100 Stories That Shaped the World. As actor Thandie Newton, whose mother was born in Zimbabwe, wrote in a social media post in August: ""The first book I read when I arrived in Cambridge to study anthropology at the university was Nervous Conditions. It was a revelation.""  A post shared by Thandie Newton (@thandienewton) The sequel, The Book of Not, was published in 2006. This Mournable Body completes the trilogy, which follows the protagonist, Tambu, through pre and post-independence Zimbabwe.  As Dangarembga told the festival audience in Lagos last year: ""The Tambudzai Trilogy examines the kind of extreme violence that you can trace from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top."" With the title inspired by an essay by Nigerian-American writer Teju Cole in The New Yorker - Unmournable Bodies - the shortlisted novel had a hard road to publication.  ""No-one was interested in This Mournable Body,"" the author revealed. She was reduced to posting excerpts on Facebook, where it drew the attention of editor Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, whose intervention eventually led to the book's publication, 30 years after Nervous Conditions.  ""Up until now, I've been writing into the void. I didn't have an agent. I didn't know whether anyone was going to engage with what I was writing apart from a few close friends and colleagues who would read my work,"" Dangarembga reflects. Thanks to renewed attention, she now has an agent.  ""I'm delighted. I am relieved that finally I get recognition that makes me feel that I have done something worthwhile with my writing.  ""I just feel that I will be able to market the works that I'm doing better. And because I am not so anxious about it, the writing process itself is easier."" The two shortlisted novels centre on African women, reinforcing the importance of stories about people's experiences on the continent.  The Shadow King is Maaza's second novel - her first, Beneath the Lion's Gaze, was published in 2010 - and revisits the war caused by the invasion of Ethiopia by Benito Mussolini's Italian troops in 1935. Her use of photography in The Shadow King subverts the colonial photographer's original intent, thus allowing hidden lives, hidden stories, to breathe again on the page.  A post shared by Maaza Mengiste (@maazamengiste) ""Mussolini understood the power of the camera and he took that to war, and I wanted to bring that into the book,"" the author told the BBC Front Row programme earlier this month. She worked on the novel for 10 years, moving to Rome and learning Italian in order to research fascist archives.  The Fulbright scholar also drew on her personal history - her great-grandmother had enlisted for the war, taking along her father's gun.  Discussions around the novels and the Booker have also focused attention on the socio-political situations in the authors' home countries.  With Ethiopia on the brink of another conflict - as clashes intensify in the country's Tigray region - the historical war at the heart of the novel offers a commentary on current events in ways the author could not have foreseen.  In Dangarembga's case, Booker recognition has helped highlight the author's principled stand against corruption in her country.  Four days after the chair of the panel of judges, Margaret Busby, announced the longlist, and with the Booker spotlight on the author, the authorities in Zimbabwe arrested Dangarembga during a peaceful protest, in an astonishing set of circumstances Newton described as ""painful and surreal"". Later released on bail, Dangarembga began a cycle of court appearance after court appearance. Charges are still hanging over her head but she remains unbowed, winning the support of many.  In September she was announced the University of East Anglia International Chair of Creative Writing; and in October she delivered the 7th Annual Oliver Tambo Memorial Lecture. The authors also welcomed their Booker nods for the potential impact on those coming behind.  ""I do think that maybe it is inspiring for younger writers who are earlier in their careers, who realise that sometimes it doesn't just happen all at once, that it takes time and you have to be dedicated and to really have a story you want to tell,"" says Dangarembga. For Maaza ""it is a confirmation of the talent that exists on the continent. It is letting African writers know that their work is noticed, it is being read"".  ""And I hope that this encourages young writers to continue to work, to put the effort in, to not give up, and to understand that it is possible not only to be read in the West but what matters also is that these books get into Asia, into Africa, into different continents, and that's happening."" South African author and publisher Zukiswa Wanner says the shortlisting of the two books ""is much-needed recognition of two excellent writers who lovers of literature from Africa have known to be excellent but the world may have underrated"".  On the day the shortlist came out, Wanner was pictured cradling both Dangarembga's and Maaza's books - an indication, perhaps, of the expectation riding on this year's prize, which will be announced on Thursday.  ""[It will be] a bonus for us all if one of them wins the prize - but if not, the shortlisting alone is a delight for us all,"" she says. And the Booker shortlist excitement on the continent should help stimulate the production of more stories about Africa, and hopefully more readers - especially with the news that Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel Half of a Yellow Sun has been voted the best book to have won the Women's Prize for Fiction in its 25-year history. This can only be good news for African publishers struggling in poorly served infrastructural and business terrains.

Covid: How will university students go home for Christmas?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News Plans have been announced for university students around the UK to get home safely for Christmas. Students in England and Wales are being asked to return home during a week-long ''travel window"" after taking coronavirus tests in early December, while Scotland is planning a more staggered return. It is hoped this will reduce the risk of students spreading Covid-19 to their family and friends, following outbreaks on campuses earlier this term. The government will ask students to travel when infection rates are lower, after testing as many as possible. Rapid Covid tests will be distributed to universities at the end of November, so students can be tested as England's lockdown ends on 2 December. This will mean students ''pose a much-reduced risk to their loved ones and their community,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says. Universities in high-risk areas will be prioritised for testing, and the aim is for results to be turned around in an hour.  Unless they test positive or develop symptoms, students will be encouraged to travel home between 3 and 9 December, with any remaining teaching conducted online.  Those found to have coronavirus will have to self-isolate for 10 days, but will still be able to get home in time for Christmas. Students are ""strongly advised"" to travel during the window, as they may not make it home for Christmas if they have to self-isolate later Wales will follow a similar procedure to England, with students asked to travel by 9 December at the latest, and offered a rapid turnaround test before they go. Students in Scotland will be allowed to return home if they return two negative tests, taken five days apart. Those who test positive would have to self-isolate before going home. The end dates of courses will be staggered to avoid a ""great surge of movement"" in December. The Northern Ireland Executive hasn't yet detailed its plans. No plans have been announced yet for what will happen in England and Wales in January - either for students to return to university safely, or whether they may have to study online from home. While there is a staggered start to the autumn term, the return in January is much more concentrated. Scotland's Universities Minister Richard Lochhead said lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in August, before finalising plans for January. Most universities went into the new academic year offering a blend of in-person and online teaching.  But some universities - including the two main ones in Manchester - have now temporarily suspended in-person teaching.  Even if you can't attend lectures in person, it is unlikely you will get a refund if you can access your course online. The government has said students shouldn't expect a refund ''if they are receiving adequate online learning"". However, some MPs have called for students to receive discounts and the National Union of Students wants refunds if ''quality of learning is severely impacted''. They may be receiving online tuition, but students have a right to access other resources too. ''If they don't have access to libraries and research facilities, students would have a claim for breach of contract,'' says Boz Michalowska-Howells, head of consumer law at Leigh Day solicitors. Any savings universities make by not providing facilities or through government schemes should be passed on to students via fee reductions, she adds. Higher education regulator the Office for Students (OfS) says it ''can and will investigate'' if it believes universities haven't taken all reasonable steps to protect standards. Some of those who have been told to self-isolate at short notice in halls are eligible for extra support.  If someone in your accommodation develops coronavirus symptoms - a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of taste or smell - they should self-isolate immediately and arrange to be tested. The rest of their household should also self-isolate - for 14 days until they know whether the test is positive. There are fines of up to Â£10,000 for failing to do so. Government guidance says universities should work with Public Health England to identify what a ""whole household isolation"" means in such circumstances.  It says it would normally include ""students living in the same flat or on the same floor who share cooking or washing facilities"". In September, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which works with the government - warned of ""significant outbreaks associated with higher education"". By early October, almost all of the local areas that had coronavirus case rates of over 1,000 also had high density student populations in England.

"Baccara would re-record Yes Sir, I Can Boogie as Scotland anthem","Spanish disco duo Baccara have said that they would re-record their 70s classic as an anthem for Scotland as the team heads to the Euros. Yes Sir, I Can Boogie is on course to return to the Top 40 after becoming the team's unofficial anthem following their win against Serbia on Thursday. And the band say they would be happy to record a new version for the finals. Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, singer Maria Mendiola said she is delighted to have new audiences. ""With this pandemic, I have been sitting at home and this has uplifted me in a way you cannot imagine,"" she said. ""I will always thank the Scottish team and especially Andy Considine for making me so happy after 43 years.  ""I saw all the articles and everyone was calling me. I was delighted. I thanked the Scotland team and spoke with Andy over Instagram. He had such nice words."" Maria said she was delighted with the new attention on her song, which spent a single week at the top of the UK charts in 1977. Asked if she would record a version for Scotland's campaign in the delayed 2020 tournament, she said: ""Of course. If they ask me, I will do it directly."" The track became a favourite with football fans after a video of ecstatic players dancing to the tune went viral. The footage showed the victorious squad bouncing in their dressing room after their win in Belgrade to clinch a place at the European Championships for the first time in 22 years. It was originally adopted by fans as a tribute to defender Andrew Considine.  The Aberdeen cult hero - who was called up to the Scotland team for the first time earlier this year at the age of 33 - famously starred in a spoof video of the song on his stag do. He dressed in drag and appeared alongside his friends and his father in the professionally-produced video which was played on his wedding day in 2015.  ð¶ Oh, yes sir... ð¶#NoScotlandNoParty pic.twitter.com/UNTLXIuHVH Considine was an unused substitute for Thursday night's historic match, which saw the Scottish men's team dramatically qualify for Euro 2020. But a video tweeted by the Scotland National Team after the game showed him in the thick of the action as he boogie-woogied with team mates including Kieran Tierney, Scott McTominay, Leigh Griffiths and Callum McGregor.  The video immediately caught the imagination of the Tartan Army, with jubilant fans starting a campaign to get the song back to number one in the charts. It is now number 18 on the Official Chart's First Look, which is based on preliminary sales and streaming data from the first 48 hours of this week's chart race. If it remains in the top 40 when the official chart is announced on Friday, it will be the song's first chart appearance in 42 years. The song, which originally sold nearly 18 million copies, was the second-highest new entry at number three on Global Radio's Big Top 40, which also counts airplay on its stations.",2020-11-16T11:54:59,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-54951970,2020-11-17 09:57:16.908288,BBC,travel,0
Platinum Jubilee: MPs and peers search for gift fit for the Queen,"By Justin ParkinsonPolitical reporter, BBC News What do you get a ninety-something monarch who has already received pretty much everything, from a gold-plated horse comb to carvings of pygmy hippos? A committee of MPs and peers has been set up to choose a gift ""fit"" for the Queen to mark the 70th anniversary of her accession, in 2022. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be a ""token of our respect"". For her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the Queen had a stained-glass window created for her in Westminster Hall. The Golden Jubilee of 2002 saw a sundial installed in Westminster's Old Palace Yard, while the 1977 Silver Jubilee resulted in a fountain being built in nearby New Palace Yard. The cross-party Project Committee - whose members include Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lords Speaker Lord Fowler - is expected to follow this understated tradition. But the Queen is used to receiving more exotic gifts from the UK, Commonwealth and beyond. These have included a wine cooler in the shape of a grasshopper, a marzipan statue and, more appetisingly perhaps, a tin of pineapple. Well-wishers have also given Her Majesty animals such as cows, jaguars, kangaroos and a sloth - which have remained in their own habitats, for fear of ecological disruption and damaging the lawns of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.  A governor-general of the Bahamas once presented the Queen with a painting of a swimming pig, while the Liberian ambassador proffered three mantelpiece-friendly wood carvings of pygmy hippos. During the 2009 G20 summit in London, US President Barack Obama added a personal touch with his present - an iPod featuring coverage of her American tour two years earlier. And a state visit by the Queen to the US in 1991 resulted in the gift of six pairs of cowboy boots - fine for a sun-drenched Texas ranch, but of more questionable use for long January walks around Sandringham. The 70th anniversary of the accession - the Queen's Platinum Jubilee - occurs on 6 February 2022. However, the main celebrations, including a four-day bank holiday weekend, will take place in June, the month in which the Coronation took place in 1953. Sir Lindsay, who like the Queen is known for his love of animals, said: ""To celebrate a Platinum Jubilee is a unique and historic first, so it is only right that we Parliamentarians mark this significant occasion with a token of our respect, affection, appreciation and thanks."" Lord Fowler said that, despite the UK's current travails, ""we still have much to look forward to, including celebrating 70 years of Her Majesty's reign in June 2022"". Solicitor-General Michael Ellis, who organised the Queen's Diamond Jubilee gift, will lead the search for its successor, funded by donations from members of both Houses. In a debate marking the Queen's 90th birthday in 2016, Mr Ellis told the House of Commons of his horror at discovering, shortly before the stained glass was placed in situ in Westminster Hall in 2010, ""that the chain on the unicorn was the wrong way round"". This was rectified in time for installation.",2020-11-12T14:37:27,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54915124,2020-11-13 14:32:44.498662,BBC,travel,0
Frome 'Iron Man' makes crisp packet blankets for homeless,"By Liz LewisBBC News A former homeless man has been turning empty crisp packets into insulated sleeping bag liners for rough sleepers. Miley Porritt, 23, of Frome, Somerset, said he had two loves - ironing and eating crisps. ""Since lockdown I've set up my own ironing business so now I can put the two things together and do some good,"" he said. It takes about 150 packets to make one liner and they are sealed together using the heat from an iron. The foil in the packet would reflect a person's body heat back on to them to help keep them warm. Mr Porritt spent five years rough sleeping and living in a YMCA hostel before getting his own flat in October. ""When you're on the street staying warm and dry is really hard so these liners will make a difference and I want to give something back to the people who helped me,"" he said. ""I love crisps so this is a great way to help others,"" he said. He also said he finds ironing ""really satisfying"" which ""makes me a bit unusual"". Mr Porritt lived for a while at the YMCA in Mendip and a spokesperson for the charity called him ""an inspiration"". ""We are very proud of how far he has come and are glad to have been part of his journey so far,"" they said. ""Miley has turned his life around and what is even more heartwarming is his determination to contribute and make a difference to other people's lives with his survival blankets."" Mr Porritt has put a call out on his Iron Man Survival Blankets Facebook group asking crisp lovers everywhere to send empty washed packets to his business address so he could turn them into the liners.  In less than a week he has had more than 1,500 shares and hundreds of comments from people asking how they can get involved. One of the groups to have replied was the Blond Angels street team, which gives hot food, toiletries, clothing and sleeping bags to rough sleepers in greater Bristol, Bath and Gloucester. ""We go through sleeping bags like nobody's business in winter because on the streets they don't last long before they're wet, smelly and unpleasant,"" said Kayleigh Gardner from the group. ""These liners will prolong the life of the sleeping bags so we can help more people."" The group has asked its 2,000 members to save washed packets and said it has had ""a fantastic response already"". Ms Gardner said she would be asking big supermarket chains if they would allow crisp packet donations to be given to Mr Porritt for the liners and also planned to ask senior schools to install crisp packet bins to collect the empty bags. ""Each bag takes about 80 years to decompose so we hope people will want to see the bags go to good use instead of landfill,"" she said.",2020-11-13T01:27:06,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-54888102,2020-11-15 16:22:53.010602,BBC,entertainment,1
Felixstowe Port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom,"By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Some shipping and haulage companies have complained of ""chaos"" at Felixstowe Port in Suffolk, affecting goods in the run-up to Christmas.   One ship due to be unloaded at the port last week was redirected to Rotterdam because of ""unacceptable"" delays. The owner, Hutchison Ports, blames pre-Brexit stockpiling and the pandemic. Freight manager Matt Hudson warned that ""if the chaos continues, increased shipping prices will be passed on to consumers"". Mr Hudson, whose company distributes goods picked up at the port, said containers were being left on the quayside because haulage companies could not book a slot to enter the site. ""It's delaying freight going into shops for consumers to buy,"" he said. ""Shops are struggling anyway at the moment because of the impact from the coronavirus. ""If retail outlets can't sell what is actually en-route at the moment in time for Christmas, potentially they could lose even more money than they have done already this year."" Last week, Taiwanese shipping firm Evergreen directed one of its ships to bypass Felixstowe because of ""serious port congestion"". The ship's cargo was unloaded in Rotterdam instead and ferried back to the UK via London's Thamesport.  An Evergreen spokesman said the firm had been told by Felixstowe's owner that a berthing slot - where cargo is unloaded - would not be available for up to 10 days after the ship's scheduled arrival.  ""Such a delay is totally unacceptable,"" he said. In a statement, Hutchison Ports UK said: ""The imbalance in UK trade and Brexit stockpiling exacerbate current operational challenges and we are working with our customers and stakeholders to get through the current congestion. ""Performance at the port remains under pressure due to the Covid pandemic, high levels of import traffic, the large number of empty containers and a large amount of unusually long-stay containers held at the port."" But in an operational note posted on its website, the company said delays at Felixstowe would continue ""at least into December and possibly through into the New Year"" - potentially causing havoc for firms still waiting on pre-Christmas stock.  In a sign of the company's woes, Hutchison Ports UK recently reinstalled its former boss Chris Lewis as chief executive. He came out of retirement to take up the role for a second time, having last led the firm in 2010. For months, hauliers have complained about Felixstowe's Vehicle Booking System (VBS) which lorry drivers must use to gain ticketed entry to the port. Freight manager Mr Hudson says in recent weeks, the situation has become worse. ""There are more containers waiting on the port while all trucking companies are logging on trying to get a slot. Sometimes the port cancels some of the VBS [slots] when drivers are actually on port waiting,"" he said.  ""We need to see improvement quickly. It's ruining a lot of people's businesses."" A spokesman for Hutchison Ports UK disputed the claims about the VBS, pointing out that in recent days, empty slots have been available and that improvements to the system are under way. Logistics UK, the trade association representing supply chain firms, said there had been a huge spike recently in the volume of cargo entering the UK.  Part of that dates back to the summer, when the UK's first lockdown eased and firms increased stock orders as the economy started to pick up. More recently, businesses have been looking ahead to 1 January and preparing for uncertainty at the end of the Brexit transition period. ""We are worried about the situation but we understand the port are working on solutions now,"" said Logistics UK policy manager Zoe McLernon. ""With the end of the transition period coming, we've got to make sure that our ports can take the goods we need."" Two months ago, the former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was hired to advise the port's parent company Hutchison Ports Europe, which is based in London. The register of MPs' financial interests shows he's being paid Â£100,000 for ""around seven hours"" of work per week.  The Department for Transport says it's aware of the issues at Felixstowe Port and, while it stressed this is a commercial matter for industry to resolve, it said it would continue to monitor the situation for any impact on wider supply chains.",2020-11-14T12:50:30,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54908129,2020-11-14 16:33:28.535638,BBC,technology,0
Dominic Cummings 'turns up with PM in Beanotown',"By Justin ParkinsonBBC News Like millions of people, he's currently working from home - but being out of sight doesn't mean Dominic Cummings is out of mind. Or the media. But coverage of the prime minister's (soon to be ex-) chief adviser is taking on a surreal tone. This week's Beano comic includes a pull-out section called Bean-OLD, designed to cheer up adults in the midst of the pandemic - and who better to help in that than Mr Cummings, the former Vote Leave impresario who quit his government role last week? One strip - commissioned before his resignation - features him (sort of) reprising his famous lockdown road trip from London to County Durham earlier this year. This time he has Boris Johnson in the back seat - alongside Wilbur Brown, the square-jawed mayor of Beanotown, who could be said to bear a slight resemblance to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.  The Beano makes play of Mr Cummings's discomfort at the furore that followed his journey and his subsequent drive to Barnard Castle, which he insisted had been an attempt to test his eyesight before the longer return south. In the comic, corrupt Mayor Brown's plot to steal Beanotown's Christmas presents goes wrong, just as Mr Johnson arrives by parachute. With Mr Brown's glasses broken by a Christmas pudding kicked in his face by footballer Marcus Rashford, Mr Cummings - who has already been lurking in the vicinity - agrees to act as the mayor's getaway driver. Their intended destination is Barnard Castle. But, after a prang in the wintry road conditions around Beanotown, wise-cracking policeman Sgt Slipper tells him: ""I'm sorry, sir, but I'll have to give you a ticket for driving without glasses."" Mr Cummings, in a white shirt like the one he wore in May when he explained his actions to the media, replies: ""But I have contacts..."" Giving the reader a withering look, the officer says: ""I don't care who you know, you're still getting a ticket. This isn't the first car crash you've been involved in this year - I remember your press conference from the Downing Street Rose Garden!"" Mr Rashford and fellow prominent campaigners Captain Sir Tom Moore and Greta Thunberg are among those who join forces with Beano anti-hero Dennis the Menace's father to try to foil Mr Brown's plot. Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, told the BBC: ""Wilbur Brown is the real baddie in this this, not the others."" ""Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson were a kind of buddy gang - a bit like Dennis the Menace and [sidekick dog] Gnasher,"" he added. ""They came as a pair for a long while, and that's what we're trying to create here. ""Dominic wants to make sure the optics for the PM's visit to Beanotown are the best they can be."" This is not the first time the Beano has forayed into political satire in its 82-year history. In 2018 it sent Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg a cease-and-desist letter, ordering him to stop ""copying"" the sartorial style and ""snootiness"" of Walter the Softy, the son of Mayor Brown and nemesis of Dennis the Menace. Mr Rees-Mogg, who has since become leader of the House of Commons, denied snootiness and refused to change his appearance, arguing that ""compared to me, Walter is Mr Muscle"". In 2008, the then Foreign Secretary David Miliband was photographed at the Labour Party conference holding a banana, which caused some opponents to dub him Bananaman, a reference to another Beano character. The comic's publisher, DC Thomson, included Mr Cummings and Mr Johnson in the latest edition after focus groups with children - who are expected to pass the adult pullout to their parents - found they had a high level of awareness of both men. The tone when dealing with Mr Cummings is gentle compared with much of that in the mainstream media in recent months. And there could be a happy ending for him following ""extraordinary times"" for himself and the country, Mr Stirling suggested. ""Maybe he'll work for Wilbur Brown as a spin doctor,"" he said. ""It might make an ongoing strip for the Beano.""",2020-11-18T01:08:09,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54976553,2020-11-18 08:20:49.142401,BBC,politics,0
Boris Johnson 'called Scottish devolution disaster',"Boris Johnson has come under fire for reportedly telling a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs that devolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. Mr Johnson also reportedly described it as predecessor Tony Blair's ""biggest mistake"". The SNP and Labour have both criticised the prime minister. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Johnson has ""always supported devolution"". ""What he does feel strongly, and I would agree, is that devolution in Scotland has facilitated the rise of separatism and nationalism in the form of the SNP, and that that's trying to break apart the United Kingdom,"" he told BBC Breakfast.  ""Anybody, like the prime minister, who loves the UK wants to keep it together thinks that that's a very, very dangerous and disappointing outcome that we need to battle against."" Mr Johnson was in a Zoom meeting with Tory MPs representing dozens of seats in northern England on Monday when he is said to have made the remarks. The Sun newspaper reported the PM had told the MPs ""devolution has been a disaster north of the border"". This comes six months before vital elections right across the UK, important particularly in Scotland, just when the SNP has been starting to warm up its campaign, and just when discussions about how the UK government ought to respond are taking place too. It is one thing - and, of course, legitimate - for political rivals to criticise each other. But to suggest the way that Scotland has been run for more than a decade is a ""disaster"" is quite another. And the worry among Scottish Tories is the implication that Boris Johnson's understanding of the political situation is far from complete. Read Laura's blog in full Mr Blair's Labour government brought in devolution for Scotland in 1999, including the setting up of a parliament in Edinburgh. A Downing Street source said: ""The PM has always supported devolution, but Tony Blair failed to foresee the rise of separatists in Scotland. ""Devolution is great - but not when it's used by separatists and nationalists to break up the UK."" Former Conservative Scottish secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said Mr Johnson's comments were ""typical"" of the ""rather loose language"" the prime minister sometimes uses. ""What he should have said is devolution has become a disaster because the Scottish national government, the SNP government in Scotland, are using the Scottish Parliament and the power they've got to try and destroy the United Kingdom,"" Sir Malcolm told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  He said the SNP has been ""pretty useless"" on domestic Scottish issues and have become ""obsessed with demands for referendums"". ""What I'm absolutely certain of is that it was not meant to be an attack on the principle of devolution,"" he said. Elections for the Scottish Parliament take place next May. The SNP is currently the largest party with 61 MSPs and the Conservative Party is the second-largest with 31 - eight seats ahead of Labour. Ms Sturgeon's SNP says a second referendum on independence - following Scotland's vote against it in 2014 - should happen if her party wins. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out. In response to Mr Johnson's reported remarks to Tory MPs, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Worth bookmarking these PM comments for the next time Tories say they're not a threat to the powers of the Scottish Parliament - or, even more incredibly, that they support devolving more powers."" She added that the ""only way to protect and strengthen"" the Scottish Parliament was through independence for Scotland. SNP MP Philippa Whitford told BBC Newsnight Mr Johnson's reported comments were ""very odd for a prime minister who claims to be trying to hold the union together"". ""It isn't just this flippant comment today,"" she said. ""It comes on the back of the internal market bill, which absolutely removes powers from Scottish Parliament."" The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said the reported remarks confirm ""Boris Johnson doesn't believe in devolution and would put the future of the United Kingdom at risk"". He added: ""Devolution is one of Labour's proudest achievements and we will always fight for a strong Scotland in the UK."" But the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, tweeted: ""Devolution has not been a disaster. The SNP's non-stop obsession with another referendum - above jobs, schools and everything else - has been a disaster."" It has been suggested by some taking part in the MPs' Zoom meeting that Mr Johnson was answering a question that had been put to him about devolution in England.

Essure: Women in England take legal action against sterilising-device maker,"By Sophie HutchinsonBBC News Lawyers have begun legal action on behalf of 200 UK women against the makers of a sterilisation device, after claims of illness and pain. The device, a small coil called Essure, was implanted to prevent pregnancies.  Manufacturer Bayer has already set aside more than $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) to settle claims from almost 40,000 women in the US.  It has withdrawn the device from the market for commercial reasons but says it stands by its safety and efficacy. The metal coil was inserted into the fallopian tube to cause scarring, blocking the tube and preventing pregnancy. Introduced in 2002, it was promoted as an easy, non-surgical procedure - a new era in sterilisation. But many women who had the device fitted have now either had hysterectomies or are waiting for procedures to remove the device. Tracey Pitcher, who lives in Hampshire, felt she had completed her family and did not want any more children. Her doctor strongly encouraged her to have an Essure device fitted, she says. But after it had been, she began to feel very unwell. ""I just started to have heavy periods, migraines, which I had only ever had when I was pregnant so they were hormonal,"" she says. ""My back was so painful I'd wake up crying in the middle of the night with pains in my hips and my back."" Tracey says she battled to persuade doctors to take her symptoms seriously. But the only information she received was from a Facebook group. ""It's easy to get it done,"" she says. ""It's easy to say, 'You have this - it's wonderful.'  ""But then the fallout - there's nobody there, there's no support apart from people that we've found ourselves, no-one will listen, because it's just 'women's things'."" More than 1,000 women have now subscribed to that Facebook page. Laura Linkson, who has helped run it, believes she was harmed by her Essure device, and says the severe physical and psychological nature of her symptoms has had a devastating impact on her family life.  ""I'd say it's destroyed my life and my children's lives,"" she says. Kim Henderson, who lives near Southampton, feels her doctor pushed her into having an Essure coil fitted.  As soon as it had been, she started feeling severe pain. Like many of the women, she was regularly admitted to hospital only to be told there was nothing wrong with her.  And she began to wonder if it was all in her head, until she found other women discussing their symptoms on the Facebook page.  ""It's been really hard,"" she says, ""not just physically but mentally. ""I feel my children have missed out on a lot. ""And it makes me feel guilty because if I hadn't had Essure, then I wouldn't be where I am now."" ""Life would be very different for me and my children."" Solicitor Lisa Lunt, head of medical product liability at the law firm PGMBM, who is leading the group action in England, says: ""The reports that have come out from the American proceedings are that [developer] Conceptus and Bayer were failing to report adverse events. ""That's when they become aware that there are problems with the device.  ""And that's something that we're going to look at very, very, carefully indeed."" Bayer strongly denies the allegations, saying it has never violated regulations around complaints. ""Patient safety is Bayer's highest priority,"" it said. ""We take all adverse events seriously, continually collect and analyse the data we receive, and work with the [US Food and Drug Administration] to monitor Essure's safety profile.   ""The company stands behind the safety and efficacy of Essure, which are demonstrated by an extensive body of research, undertaken by Bayer and independent medical researchers, involving more than 270,000 women over the past two decades."" But some doctors who have fitted Essure devices remain sceptical. Gynaecology professor Bas Veersema, an expert in Essure removal, at UMC Utrecht hospital, in Holland, says the monitoring of new medical devices is inadequate. ""We learned from the mesh problems, we have learned from the breast implants, we have learned from the Essure device, that if you put materials in the body for a long time, we need more information, with long follow-ups, what it does to the body,"" he says. ""And, to be honest, we don't know."" The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority. ""And there is currently no evidence to suggest any increased risk to patient safety.  ""Any women with questions should speak to their GP or healthcare professional.""",2020-11-15T00:09:16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54420174,2020-11-15 16:14:19.631919,BBC,technology,0
Covid-19: Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors,"By David ShukmanBBC News science editor Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as winter approaches and people spend more time indoors. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus.  But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings.  Good ventilation matters in five ways. When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be ""airborne transmission"" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air.   According to workplace regulations set up before the pandemic, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, says Dr Hywel Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: ""If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected."" From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit.  The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. In other words, it's recirculating the air.  This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. A study of a restaurant in China blamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was ""pre-symptomatic"" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms.  Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected.  Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: ""If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply.  ""Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,"" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity.   ""The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building."" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants.  .  The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy.  A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through.  Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others.  If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can ""show us where to punch and when to punch"" in tackling infections.   Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key.  But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple.  Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe.  He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind.  ""If you open a window, where is the air going to go?"" he asks. ""We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. ""More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences.""  I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes.  She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus.  But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.

Covid: CaffÃ¨ Nero seeks help after pandemic 'decimates' trading,"CaffÃ¨ Nero has been forced to launch a restructuring of its business following the second lockdown. The coffee chain is launching a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) which will allow it to renegotiate terms with its landlords and other creditors. CaffÃ¨ Nero, which employs 6,000 workers, said ""the pandemic has decimated trading"". It said it was able to navigate the first shutdown but the subsequent fire break necessitated ""further action"". The company trades across 800 shops in the UK and a further 200 sites overseas. A company facing insolvency can use a CVA to continue to trade while paying creditors such as landlords over a fixed period - if those creditors agree.   CaffÃ¨ Nero said it had converted many of its shops to takeaway-only services during the first lockdown in March. But following the second shutdown, it said that, ""with many people continuing to work from home, ongoing limits to social interaction and a sustained reduction to footfall in city centres, it is unclear how long this will impact CaffÃ¨ Nero"".  It add that the CVA would allow the company ""to better manage its fixed costs moving forward"". ""Like so many businesses in the hospitality sector, the pandemic has decimated trading, and although we had made significant progress in navigating the financial challenges of the first lockdown, the second lockdown has made it imperative that we take further action."" said Gerry Ford, the chain's founder and chief executive. Accountancy firm KPMG has been appointed to oversee the CVA process, and landlords and creditors have until 30 November to vote on the proposal. It is understood CaffÃ¨ Nero is proposing to move most sites to turnover-based rent, and that any store closures it is  forced to make will be minimal. The hospitality sector has been one of the worst affected industries by the coronavirus pandemic because of a dearth of office workers and commuters, which are key customers. In the summer, Pret a Manger announced it was cutting 3,000 jobs, around a third of its workforce while Costa Coffee said it would axe 1,650 roles. ""Like many others across the sector, the impact of measures introduced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been devastating,"" said Will Wright, head of regional restructuring at KPMG.  ""In putting forward this CVA proposal, the directors have worked hard to strike a fair compromise with stakeholders to provide the flexibility the business urgently needs to get it through the pandemic.""",2020-11-13T10:28:21,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54929684,2020-11-13 14:26:02.660615,BBC,financial,0
Sophie McCartney: The comedian giving mums the Attenborough treatment,"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter Observing other mums on a wild hen night while she was sober inspired comedian Sophie McCartney to make spoof Attenborough-style videos about parenthood. Her Planet Birth series has now won a Funny Women award. Being part of a drunken hen or stag party is, as most people will know, a very different experience from watching one while sober. So when Sophie McCartney went on a hen do while pregnant and therefore tee-total, she suddenly had a new, clear-headed view of the night's high-spirited antics. ""There were a lot of mums out in the group, and I was watching them all. I was like, oh my goodness, is this what we are like?"" she laughs. ""I was seeing it with a fresh pair of eyes."" Her fellow young mums were the most raucous, she says. ""It was a bit like they were on day release and it doesn't normally happen, so you all get ridiculously overexcitedâ¦ and maybe you're a little bit out of touch with the drinking as well so you have a few too many. ""You don't know your limits any more. And they just all go wild."" McCartney watched this form of wild life like David Attenborough observing the rituals and interactions of a particularly boisterous species. And that gave her an idea. She had already been posting popular comedy videos and parody songs online, and decided to create a series taking the Attenborough approach to all aspects of motherhood. The first video was of The Hungover Mum. ""Having lived through hangovers as a parent, it's pretty awful,"" the 36-year-old says. ""Having to pull yourself together and still go to football and stand at the side of the pitch and cheer, and also wanting to go and crawl into a bush and die a slow death."" That was followed by wildlife mockumentaries about the School Run Mum, the Birthday Mum, the Exercise-Shy Mum and the Lockdown Mum. ""It was too easy in a way to take that approach and look at mums like that,"" the comedian says. The six episodes have had more than 15 million views on Facebook, and Planet Birth was voted best web series at last month's Funny Women Awards. McCartney took up comedy in 2017 with a parody of Ed Sheeran's Shape of You - inspired by having young children - with lyrics like: ""Last night you were in my room / And now my bedsheets smell like poo."" She almost didn't post it, worrying that the couple of dozen people she expected to watch would think her ridiculous. But the reception went far beyond anything she imagined. ""By the evening it had hit a million and I was like, oh, I think that's quite good. From there it just snowballed."" The play count had reached more than 20 million when Sheeran's record label came across it. ""Universal weren't very happy with me,"" she says. ""Touchy. It's a grey area with music on the internet. So I had to take it down. But I didn't get sued, so it was a good day for everybody."" From there, she started making regular videos with a humorous take on family life. ""Some things are exaggerated to a comedic point, as with all comedy, but then there are a lot of situations that I've lived through myself,"" she says. Her recent videos include Nitbag, a Fleabag spoof about head lice. ""Pretty much everything in there I've lived through for the past three weeks and it's been godawful. So I take inspiration from literally things that are happening on a day-to-day basis,"" she says. ""If you didn't laugh at half the things that happened to you on a daily basis, you'd just cry in a corner."" The most-viewed video on her Facebook page is a chronicle of an underwhelming, over-priced day out at a family festival, which features McCartney dragging her screaming daughter through the mud while attempting to stay cheerful. Lots of people will have been there. ""A lot of the struggles I go through on a day-to-day basis, the laughs or the bad days, I know 90% of the other mums and dads out there are also going through at the same time,"" McCartney says. ""They like to be able to laugh at the good and the bad."" Some things in life have no funny side, however. In August, McCartney broke with her usual tone to post a video titled Miscourage about having a miscarriage, and having to go through the process in hospital on her own because of the pandemic. ""It was quite cathartic for me because it was almost a process of getting it off my chest and letting it all out and talking about it,"" she says. ""But I also knew there were so many women that would have gone through exactly the same thing, a lockdown miscarriage when you weren't allowed partners to be with you, and it was a very traumatic experience. ""I wanted to break down the taboo of miscarriage and the fact that we feel like we can't talk about it, especially when you're under 12 weeks. I was 11 at the time. When I thought about it, I thought, how ridiculous that we don't tell people until we're 12 weeks because we're worried about something happening. ""But then actually when something does happen, nobody knows, and nobody knows to help, and it's a bit of a weird one to just pick up the phone and be like, 'I haven't seen you in weeks, and by the way I've just had a miscarriage'. So I just wanted to put my story out there to hopefully encourage other women to speak about their own."" As the resulting comments prove - like with the subjects she chooses for her comedy - it is a situation lots of people have lived through. She has returned to mining her rich seam of lighter parenting moments, and is also making spoof make-up tutorials, writing a book, and has had talks with a TV production company. In the moments when she's struggling to be productive, however, Liverpool-born McCartney tries to draw motivation from her dad's cousin - a musician named Paul. ""Sometimes I whack on a couple of Beatles tracks and go, OK, just do something. Do something more with your life,"" she laughs. ""It's quite good to have that as a benchmark, to have one of the most famous men on the planet to look up to."" Before lockdown, she also started performing live stand-up, which she says is ""something I never thought I'd do in a million years"". She adds: ""It's the most terrifying thing I've ever done in my entire life but it was also the best. It's this weird adrenaline junkie thing when you do stand-up. You fret about it for weeks before you do it. I felt sick every day. And then I did it, and I was like, I want to do it again!"" She's hoping to get back on stage soon, and admits she's lucky to have been able to keep earning money from making people laugh online during lockdown. ""It's been quite difficult for a lot of comedians going the other way - [people] who have been big on the circuit but maybe not had as big a social media following,"" she says. ""So I'm very fortunate to call this my job and still get paid for it and be OK.""",2020-11-17T00:43:09,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54871427,2020-11-17 09:59:06.258611,BBC,entertainment,1
Covid-19: South Australia to enter 'circuit breaker' lockdown,"The state of South Australia will enter an immediate six-day lockdown to curb the spread of a coronavirus outbreak discovered days ago. The state has detected 36 cases since infections were found in Adelaide on Sunday, the first community cases detected in six months. Authorities say the ""circuit breaker"" measures were necessary to stop the virus' spread ""at the beginning"". Australia has previously also responded aggressively to small outbreaks. Various state governments have at times closed parts of the economy, enforced border restrictions and other measures to stop the virus' spread. The lockdown, to begin at midnight on Wednesday, comes just weeks after neighbouring state Victoria beat a second wave, which caused about 800 deaths. South Australia's restrictions from Thursday 19 November  There would be a further eight days of lesser restrictions following the ""six day pause"", officials said. Almost immediately after the lockdown announcement, images on social media showed people queuing at supermarkets to buy toilet paper and other supplies.  Authorities had urged people to avoid panic-buying, confirming supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open. Huge crowds have already filled shopping centres at Port Pirie. After the State Government announced tough new restrictions to fight a coronavirus cluster in #Adelaide. @abcadelaide @abcnews pic.twitter.com/rAp3tiQpo7 South Australia's Premier Stephen Marshall called on residents to ""rise to the challenge again"" in the sudden, second lockdown. ""We need a circuit breaker to stay ahead of this,"" he said. ""We need breathing space for contact tracing to protect the elderly, to protect the vulnerable, to protect our entire community."" On Wednesday, the state reported two new cases out of 9,500 tests. Officials said it was a ""small but critical"" number. Most Australian states had already moved this week to shut their borders to South Australian residents. Like Victoria's outbreak, the re-emergence of the virus in South Australia has come from a hotel quarantine site. This has prompted re-examination of quarantine safety measures. Officials said a cleaner had become infected and spread it to people in the local community. Australia closed its borders to international travellers in March but has allowed citizens and permanent residents to return home if they undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel. About one-fifth of the country's cases have been found in returning travellers. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said South Australia's speedy move ""draws on lessons from earlier outbreak experiences"". Australia, which has reported 907 deaths and about 28,000 cases had in recent weeks seen its cases drop to near zero after Victoria's successful suppression of the virus.  However that effort had required a stringent four-month lockdown of state capital Melbourne, where residents could not freely leave their homes and faced a curfew.  The state was able to reduce its case rate to zero from a peak of 700 new cases per day in that period. Its full lockdown began when nearly 100 new cases were being reported per day.",2020-11-18T05:45:16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-54983104,2020-11-18 08:19:14.759908,BBC,world,0
"EU-UK talks: 'Make or break' moment approaching, say both sides","Trade talks between the UK and EU are reaching the ""make or break"" point, the two sides have said, with key differences proving hard to resolve. EU sources said there had been less progress in recent days on outstanding sticking points than they had hoped for and the ""moment of truth"" was nearing. UK sources said there were still ""quite big gaps"" between the sides. Both sides doubted that a draft deal could now be reached in the coming days, as the EU had originally hoped. The two sides are in a race against the clock to settle their future economic partnership in time for it to take effect on 1 January, when the UK will leave the EU's single market and customs union.  UK sources indicated there had been no breakthrough this week between the UK's negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, with the two ending their discussions in a similar position to how they started them.  An EU source familiar with the process said one of their meetings had been ""short and brutal"".  The two men are due to meet again in Brussels on Monday ahead of what is shaping up to be a critical week. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the EU would like to reach a draft agreement in the next few days, in time for the leaders of its 27 member countries to discuss it at a virtual conference on Thursday.  But she said it was possible that this working deadline would be missed, with a deal now perhaps not being concluded until early December.  Unresolved issues include the EU's insistence on a ""level-playing field"" in rules and regulations between British firms and those on the continent, and guarantees to prevent the lowering of standards known as ""non-regression"". Other areas of disagreement surround fishing quotas and legal mechanisms for enforcing any agreement. The UK left the EU on 31 January but is continuing to follow many of the bloc's rules until 31 December, when the 11-month post-Brexit transition period ends.  UK ministers had expressed increasing optimism in recent weeks about the state of negotiations with cabinet minister Michael Gove suggesting the ""penny is dropping"" in Brussels over the UK's post-Brexit status as an independent nation. Philip Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU from 2017 to 2019, said the deal on the table was ""relatively thin"" but better than no deal. ""I've always thought a deal was more likely than no deal - but only just,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It still requires compromise on both sides,"" he added. ""It is about the balance of obligations and benefits for both sides and there are some very big decisions still to be made."" If a trade deal is not agreed, the UK will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules - leading to tariffs being introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs for businesses and consumers. Both sides say they want to avoid this outcome, but the the EU has said it will not do a deal ""at any price"", and Mr Johnson has said the UK will prosper either way.  If a deal is agreed, it would need to be signed off by MPs in the UK and parliaments across the EU before the end of the transition period to come into force by 1 January.

"Covid-19: Scotland tiers, Biden warning and home working","Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. The Scottish government will decide later whether to place some areas under its highest level of coronavirus restrictions. The places causing most concern are Glasgow, North and South Lanarkshire, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - with a total population of about 1.8 million. The level four controls would mean all hospitality, non-essential shops, gyms and salons would have to close.Â Schools would stay open. Read the rules in detail. A senior health official has suggested the regional tiered system of measures in England - explained here - may have to be ""strengthened"" to get the country ""through the winter"". Public Health England's Susan Hopkins said tier one had ""very little effect"" and the impact of tier two was inconsistent. Our health correspondent Nick Triggle says the discussion in government about what happens after lockdown, which ends on 2 December, is very much ongoing.  Campaign group the English Collective of Prostitutes says about 80% of sex workers are single mothers barely making ends meet and England's second lockdown is going to push them ""even deeper into crisis"" because they're unable to claim ""the entitlements available to other workers"". The warning is echoed by a charity, Bristol-based One25, which has had to close its women-only safe space, cutting off access to healthcare. The pandemic's potential impact on another vulnerable group - children in care - is also highlighted this morning, with a warning about drug gangs. President-elect Joe Biden has warned Donald Trump's refusal to hand over power to him in the usual way could cost lives. The government agency that handles the transition hasn't recognised the incoming administration and sensitive information and briefings haven't been given to them. Crucially, the Biden team is excluded from planning around coronavirus, and in particular, a vaccination distribution strategy. Former first lady Michelle Obama is also urging Mr Trump to step aside. How bad is the coronavirus situation in the US right now? We look closely here. Even if a vaccine comes soon, many people may never go back to the office full time. And the early signs of how the pandemic has affected the UK's mental health are not good.

Coronavirus: What is a recession and how could it affect me?,"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News The recession is over. The UK saw the best economic growth on record. But times are still hard, and the economy is not actually doing that well.  How can all these things be true at the same time, and why does it matter? In normal times, a country's economy grows.  Its citizens, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes their value falls, and a recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. It's a sign the economy is doing badly. The first two quarters of 2020 saw GDP falling sharply, making it the worst recession on record, and the first in the UK since 2009. For most people, economic growth is good.  It usually means there are more jobs, and companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more.  A growing economy also gives the government more money in taxes. So it can cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. The third quarter of 2020 saw the UK economy growing again, meaning that technically the recession was over. July to September saw the fastest three-month growth on record - 15.5% - which would be extraordinary in normal times.  But what the figures capture is an economy shutting down and reopening again. Shops and restaurants closed in the spring during the nationwide shutdown, and reopened in the summer.  People started going out, taking holidays and getting back to some of their normal lives. They spent more money, bringing the amount of economic activity closer to where it was last year. However there is still a big gap between how the economy was doing last year, and where it stands today. Though the recession is over, the economy is 9.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic. That reflects the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs, and millions are still on furlough, with the government paying most of their wages. Many businesses still have far less trade than before the pandemic.  It takes a while for statisticians to calculate the size of the economy, so their figures always describe the recent past, not what's happening today. The latest figures run to the end of September, before wide-ranging new lockdowns were introduced around the UK.  However, the recovery's pace was already slowing down in September. When figures for the October to December quarter are published, they may well show GDP falling again as England's nationwide lockdown and measures in other nations hit the economy.  If the following quarter also sees a fall, then that would be a second recession, or what is sometimes called a ""double-dip"" recession, where two recessions happen close together.  However, Bank of England forecasts expect to see growth next year. And if an effective vaccine becomes widely available, that would strongly boost the recovery.  The UK has been doing worse than other major worldwide economies. The UK economy is 9.7% smaller than it was before the crisis began, but the US is only 3.5% smaller. France is 4.1% down, Germany is 4.2% down, and Spain is 9.1% down. The UK's poor performance compared with other countries is partly down to a longer lockdown, experts believe.  The world economy will shrink by 4.4% in total this year, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts. This is less bad than the Fund expected three months ago, as the recession was less severe than they expected.  Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to get promotions, or a pay rise. Graduates and school leavers could find a first job harder to get. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase.  For instance, many UK homeowners who kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. Mortgage interest payments for many fell considerably, leaving them with more spending money. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. In the UK, the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards.  GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period. Unemployment rose sharply, but began to fall back again two years later.  And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services. This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity. There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid.  The 2020 recession has caused the government to run an even bigger deficit, and national debt has also grown rapidly during the period. An effective vaccine would give the recovery the biggest possible boost.  In the meantime, the UK government and others around the world are borrowing huge sums to pay for schemes to protect jobs, support businesses and combat the virus.  The Bank of England is also supporting the economy by through quantitative easing, where it tries to encourage individuals and businesses to invest and spend more by buying government bonds.

Tigray crisis: Why Ethiopia is spiralling out of control,"By Alex De WaalEthiopia analyst Ethiopia appears to be fast approaching civil war. Fighting between forces loyal to the federal government headed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has claimed hundreds of lives and is threatening to rip the country apart. While battles rage on the ground, the two sides are also fighting a war of words. Each is trying to rally their people and also to convince the world that they have the moral high ground. The government in Addis Ababa and the TPLF accuse one another of firing the first shots. Mr Abiy has said that army officers were murdered in cold blood.  The Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael says there was a co-ordinated attack by Ethiopian special forces and troops from neighbouring Eritrea. Until there is an independent investigation, the rival stories remain allegations without evidence, which are being used to whip up hostile sentiments. The two sides see Ethiopia's history totally differently. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a revolution in 1974. A military junta known as the Derg seized power. It inflicted the infamous ""Red Terror"", when tens of thousands of young people were murdered by the military regime, and a prolonged civil war against insurgents across the country. The Tigrayans remember those as years of darkness, when daily bombing raids by air force jets forced them to move only at night. In one terrible air raid in 1988 on the town of Hausien, 1,800 marketgoers died and the smoke and dust from the bombardment literally turned a bright day as dark as midnight.  A coalition led by the TPLF, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) defeated the military government in 1991.  On the day they took power, the EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi, a Tigrayan, said that his number one goal was for Ethiopians to be able to eat three meals a day.  Over the EPRDF's 27 years in power the child mortality rate fell from about one in five to one in 20.  Famine was banished. Large-scale civil war was ended. But Ethiopia did not see democracy. Prime Minister Abiy and his followers call these ""27 years of darkness"". A rising generation of young people felt silenced and shut out of political participation.  They argue that a clique of Tigrayans dominated politics, the army and the economy for their own benefit.  Abiy Ahmed, an ethnic Oromo, was swept to power on a wave of discontent. The EPRDF chose him as party leader - and hence prime minister - in 2018.  He rapidly liberalised politics. He dissolved the EPRDF coalition and set up a new party - the Prosperity Party.  These moves won him popular acclaim. His critics acidly remarked ""to dismantle is not to build"". Mr Abiy made peace with Eritrea, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, and became a close confidante of President Isaias Afwerki, despite the Eritrean leader's long-stated aim of dismantling Ethiopia, beginning with its army. Mr Abiy is a devout Pentecostalist and often speaks as though his mandate is from God.   His writings, including his PhD summary, read like self-help business school manuals.  He has supreme confidence that dynamic, self-assured active leadership generates its own reality. Without doubt he has massive support among the Amharas in Addis Ababa and the Amhara region. But neither he nor his new party have faced any electoral test.  Yet Mr Abiy says that the TPLF crossed a red line when it held regional elections in September.  The federal government had not authorised those elections and the Prosperity Party was not able to contest.  The TPLF counters that national elections had been scheduled for earlier in the year and repeatedly postponed - partly because of Covid-19 - and that the government's term had expired without a firm date for a poll. They say that theirs is the only regional government with a mandate from the voters. The political battleground is Ethiopia's constitution. The country has a federal system in which the major ethnic groups administer their own regions. This was adopted in 1994 shortly after the EPRDF took power. Mr Abiy wants to do away with it. Uniquely, Ethiopia's regional states have a right to self-determination.  The spirit of this provision was that if there were to be a democratic collapse at the centre, a region could go its own way.  This was demanded not just by the Tigrayans, but by leaders from other historically marginalised groups, including the Oromo - Ethiopia's largest ethnic group. The TPLF has not demanded separation. But the logic of today's confrontation is leading them down that path.  TPLF political domination was resented by many Oromos and other ethnic groups in southern Ethiopia. But all of them treasured the self-government articles in the constitution.  Indeed, one of these groups - the Sidama - voted to have their own federal state last year.  This year, Mr Abiy has turned against the Oromo youth movement that brought him to power.  After the killing of the Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa, more than 150 people died in riots and Mr Abiy clamped down and imprisoned upwards of 10,000 people.  Among them are Jawar Mohamed, founder of the Oromo Media Network, who faces terrorism charges. Another is veteran opposition leader Lidetu Ayalew who remains in prison despite a court ordering his release. Armed gangs calling themselves the Oromo Liberation Army killed more than 50 Amhara villagers in Wollega district two weeks ago.  Mr Abiy blamed ""Ethiopia's enemies"" determined to ""rule or ruin the country"" - code words for the TPLF.  His power base is among a mostly Amhara political elite that wants to abolish the federal system in favour of a unitary government system.  There are many good reasons to criticise ethnic federalism, but Ethiopia's diverse groups have made it clear that - well armed and politically aware - they cannot be ruled against their will. Reports from the war front indicate a massacre of Amhara civilians. Reports from Addis Ababa and other towns tell of the mass round-up and internment of Tigrayans.  Government forces have imposed a news blackout on Tigray. They are also mounting a total blockade on the region, halting supplies of humanitarian aid. The TPLF says it has captured Eritrean troops who invaded Tigray. Mr Abiy's declared war aim is to impose federal control on Tigray.  No observer of Ethiopia believes that is possible. Eritrea's president, who some believe may have been involved in the planning of the Tigray invasion, has not spoken. Ethiopia's conflict is escalating out of control by the day.  This will probably cost tens of thousands of lives. And as the government's own 2002 national security white paper foresaw: ""The prospect of disintegration cannot be totally ruled out.""

Covid bereavement: Call for greater support for those left behind,"By Nelli BirdBBC News ""They called me at midnight and I knew I was going in just to say goodbye."" When Andrea Williams arrived at her husband's hospital bedside, she played their wedding song and told him it was time to rest. Mark was 58 years old when he died in April, just weeks after contracting Covid-19. Andrea shared her story as families called for greater access to bereavement support for those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic. To date more than 2,000 people are known to have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales figures. Many who have lost loved ones say they were unable to say goodbye due to lockdown restrictions, while doctors have spoken of comforting patients whose relatives have been unable to be at their bedsides when they died. Now, a virtual group has been set up for those grieving to support each other. The Covid-19 Families Wales' Group is calling for greater access to bereavement counselling during the pandemic. The Welsh Government said it had given Â£900,000 to hospices and services to help those who had lost loved ones during this time. ""I find it easier if I am talking to someone who also lost their husband,"" said Andrea. The couple had only been married for two years when Mark, a lecturer, from Sully in the Vale of Glamorgan, died on 25 April, after being on a ventilator at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. ""I played our wedding music and just said goodbye. I told him it was time to rest,"" she said, remembering the moment he died. Andrea said she knew she would not be judged on the group when she discussed things like taking her husband's ashes to bed with her when she could not sleep. ""They know exactly what I am going through."" When Terry Andrews, a retired psychiatric nurse, died at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Denbighshire, in April, his family was unable to be at his bedside. The 75-year-old had been ill for some time and on haemodialysis in hospital, but died after testing positive for coronavirus. ""It just goes through my head that we weren't there for him,"" his daughter Samantha Andrews-Pierce said. Samantha, from Denbigh, said she had found comfort in the group and had struggled with not being able to say goodbye to her father properly due to restrictions. ""We haven't been able to bury him,"" she said. ""We haven't had a wake, which I think is a massive thing when you're grieving. We had 10 at the funeral [but] we weren't allowed to sit with our mum."" Mandy Howells, from Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the death of her father, 79-year-old Dennis Kierle, in April still ""didn't seem real"". ""I try to put a brave face on when I'm with my mum,"" she said. ""I feel that, on this group... they know exactly what you are feeling and thinking because they are going through it themselves.  ""It's helped me - emotionally."" The group is now trying to get members access to counselling, but Nicola Thomas from Swansea said there was a waiting list for support. Her father, John Bennett, a project manager for Tata Steel, died aged 69 after contracting the virus in April. ""In relation to bereavement, there is a feeling that the GPs tend to offer you anti-depressants or diazepam to help you sleep, but counselling is important as well,"" she said. ""The effects on the bereaved doesn't get talked about very much on the news. ""As soon as we are able, we want to get together as a group - even if it's just a coffee and share stories. We can gain something from that kind of friendship.   ""We've got a common aim that we want our relatives remembered."" The Welsh Government said it had provided Â£900,000 of support to hospices and bereavement providers to increase the level of support. It comes after an announcement earlier this year of an additional Â£1m for bereavement services from April next year. ""We send our heartfelt condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this cruel virus,"" a spokesman said. ""We are also developing a national bereavement framework to support the establishment of clear referral pathways, bereavement standards and a directory of available bereavement provision.""",2020-11-13T00:09:12,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54920239,2020-11-13 14:34:21.716468,BBC,entertainment,0
Jordan North: The football fans missing their 'happy place',"By Joseph LeeBBC News When BBC Radio 1 DJ Jordan North got through his I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here viper challenge by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium - he sparked a wave of online jokes. But among the gags about whether Turf Moor is happier for Burnley or the away supporters was a truth for many football fans: their home ground has always been a source of solace and community in tough times. That was true until this year, when the pandemic closed the stadiums. So how much are football fans missing their hallowed turf and how are they coping? Being held up by his dad on the terraces of Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of Adam Murray's first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says. Going to the match has always been a multi-generational family affair, Adam says, with friends meeting up for a drink beforehand and joining their families at seats they've had for years. So losing this has been just one more way in which the virus is keeping loved ones apart. Adam says he still keeps in touch with the club community through its LGBT group Rainbow Blades, which holds regular social gatherings over Zoom. Members trade banter with other teams' LGBT groups, along with ideas for making football a better place for gay fans and players. The sport still has a long way to go, he says. But he adds: ""For some people it may be the only place where they can go and be part of a community and be accepted. For some people, not being able to be in that community now might be quite isolating."" The last time he saw the club play at the stadium, his 73-year-old father was close to tears as he praised them as the best Sheffield Utd side he had ever seen. ""We're winning every week, it just couldn't be any better than this."" Adam says it saddens him that ""we were completely robbed of that because of the virus"". And he believes that the lack of fan support has been a factor in the club's poor start to this season, leaving it languishing at the bottom of the table. ""There's definitely something missing: it's not talent or ability, it's that togetherness we share,"" he says. ""There's a real feeling that without that togetherness of United we can't do it."" Football writer Harry Pearson, a fan of northern non-league football, said the period before the second lockdown provided a rare phenomenon. Because capacity was limited to just 150 people in some cases, even some of the smallest clubs would have crowds locked outside, clamouring to get in. ""They were standing outside trying to watch the game through the gates. It's never been known, such a thing in the Northern League that people were locked out,"" he says. The author of The Farther Corner: A Sentimental Return to North-East Football says many non-league grounds are ""a home away from home"" for fans, with many missing the companionship more than the sport. ""There's never been any real sort of violence or trouble, it does generally seem like a happy community,"" Harry says. He jokes that he shares a phobia of snakes and could imagine chanting about Dunston FC's UTS Stadium under stress. The community of the football stadium offers a chance to break free of other concerns, Harry suggests. ""Like walking a dog"" - he says you bump into the same people all the time for a friendly chat without any pressure to get to know them deeply. ""You're pleased to see them, you stand next to them for 90 minutes exchanging mild witticisms about old footballers from the 1970s, but you don't know anything about them,"" he says. ""When you keep things just on the level of football, it's a good escape."" But for now, there isn't any football at all at this level. So how is Harry coping? ""I've been watching a lot of old YouTube things. I've been gradually working my way through the European Championships of my teenage years. That's how I'm dealing with it.""",2020-11-17T16:54:09,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54978744,2020-11-18 08:22:25.228821,BBC,sports,0
Minehead residents nickname visiting grey seal 'Jeff',"People in a coastal town have been doing their best to make sure a special visitor is given his personal space. A grey seal, which people in Minehead in Somerset have nicknamed 'Jeff', has become a regular visitor recently. The young male has been using the town's harbour slipway to rest, and signs have gone up asking people to not get too close. A wildlife expert said young seals often explore new places at this time of year having just left their mothers. Dan Jarvis, from British Divers Marine Life Rescue said: ""We'd seen reports about him [Jeff] and stories on social media so we've been aware of him for a little bit. ""It is an unusual place for a seal to haul up but the reason for that is it's currently the pupping season for the grey seal species that we get here around the south west of England. ""As the youngsters become fully independent of their mother at three weeks old, they go off and figure out the world for themselves."" Mr Jarvis said Jeff, and other seals like him, shouldn't be approached. ""He looks to be in good health so we're not concerned about him in that way but we would reinforce the message that he should be left to his own devices,"" he said. ""He shouldn't be stroked or interfered with or approached."" Jeff is capable of travelling ""huge distances"" despite his young age, added Mr Jarvis. ""Studies have shown seals travel from all around south-west England to Wales, Ireland and even France,"" he said. ""So he could have already come a huge distance and is spending his time where he is because he's quite tired and needs to conserve his energy.""",2020-11-09T16:55:02,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-54864896,2020-11-14 11:16:21.846188,BBC,travel,0
In pictures: Diwali celebrations around the world,"People around the world have gathered to mark Diwali. The festival of light is observed by Hindus, Sikhs and Jains worldwide. It celebrates the victory of good over evil and commemorates Lord Ram's return after years of exile. Lighting candles, or sparklers, is a customary part of Diwali. Along with lighting candles and fireworks, another traditional part of Diwali is rangoli art, where intricate patterns are made on the ground using coloured powder, flower petals or other materials. For Sikhs, the festival celebrates the release of the sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, in 1619, and many devotees gathered at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, in India. Diwali has also been marked in many other countries around the world. In Nepal, where the festival of lights is known as Tihar, many houses of the capital Kathmandu are decked with coloured lights.  But the coronavirus pandemic means this year's festival is different for many of those celebrating. At this temple in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, worshippers wore masks and had their temperatures taken before entering Face masks were also seen at this temple in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

'We met through MoneySavingExpert',"My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here, Laura Hawcroft, 51, a strategy and planning assistant for Network Rail in Manchester, takes us through her week's spending. Laura and her husband Rik met through the discussion forum of the website MoneySavingExpert, which they had both joined to try to reduce their spending. They even got married on a Tuesday because it was the cheapest day to do so. Laura works full-time for Network Rail. Rik looks after the house and garden, as well as being primary care-giver to their severely autistic son Andrew, 11. They bought their home six years ago and are currently over-paying Â£100 on the mortgage each month to shorten its term. Andrew receives the highest rate of disability benefits, some of which are surrendered towards a Motability lease car. During the Covid-19 pandemic Laura has worked from home much of the time: the money spent on tram tickets has dropped, but the number of bacon butties has increased dramatically. Their family holiday in June was cancelled; and the closure of soft play and trampoline parks over the summer restricted the number of activities suitable for Andrew. But Laura feels lucky in that she has a garden and spent a lot of the summer outside as a family, even camping in the garden in a Freecycle'd tent. Laura started her blog on Monday 19th October 2020. Over to Laura... The day starts with organising breakfast for our cat, myself, and then our son (in that order). I'm happy to eat own-brand cereal, but Andrew has shown a marked preference for a particular brand and this is a battle not worth fighting at 07:00. The minibus arrives to take him to his special school at 08:30, a daily service provided as part of his educational support; his day will only cost Â£2.40 for lunch. The postman delivers a toy that we bought online to put into Andrew's Christmas sack. It was a special offer that Rik spotted on HotUKDeals, saving Â£20 off the current shop price. Later a courier arrives to collect a large parcel that we sold on eBay yesterday, generating Â£145 for Andrew's piggybank. Other auction items didn't sell, so they will be taken to a local charity shop at the end of the week.  Our meals tend to follow a pattern, so Monday is ""pie night"". The pies were bought as part of the weekly supermarket shop, but we treat ourselves to fresh chips from the local takeaway at Â£1.30 for a huge portion to share between us. Total spend: Â£3.70 More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you. Routine is important for Andrew to understand what will happen and what is expected of him, so Tuesday starts exactly the same as Monday (as will Wednesday and Thursday). His uniform has no specific school badges so we can buy - and replace - his uniform cheaply. We probably spend more on batteries for his favourite musical toys than we do on clothes for him.  Once the school bus has departed, I make a coffee for Rik who is now getting up. I'm a lark where he's an owl - it is a pattern that suits us, as our son varies in his need for sleep and can often demand attention in the early hours. So I get our son off to school and Rik will take care of him when he comes home. I make a large mug of tea for myself, and shut myself into the spare bedroom to start work. An after-work, midweek shop for fresh food at the supermarket sets us back Â£8.23 with two photo frames adding Â£4.50 to our spend. Dinner tonight is homemade chilli con carne and rice. Rik made a large chilli last week and froze half for another meal; chilli always seems hotter after being frozen.  Total spend: Â£12.73 As for many, working from home has become my norm rather than a chance to escape from a busy open-plan office. My head of department is very protective of the team, and recommended we change to home-working one week before Boris announced lockdown back in March. I try to liven up our team's daily call by having a different background every day; I'm currently working through a selection of television shows from childhood, so today my video feed features Hong Kong Phooey. Today feels like a very low-spend day but, on checking online banking, I find that direct debits totalling Â£30.49 have gone out for my mobile phone and for union membership. I then remember a late-night birthday present purchased on eBay on Monday (Â£13.99), and pre-ordering a special meal to collect on Thursday (a definite splurge at Â£13.72 for just one person!) Writing this blog is forcing me to think about all the ways in which money leaves our hands. Total spend: Â£58.20 Tonight our son will stay overnight at respite, so he gets onto his minibus carrying a small suitcase of clean clothes and toys. We receive a direct payment from Children's Services to fund these breaks, which we choose to spend with Together Trust so that Andrew can stay at one of their houses; the funding buys one night of respite every two months - Â£458.  Whilst Andrew is at respite, Rik and I would normally go out for the evening, perhaps ten-pin bowling, perhaps a meal; but Covid-19 has made such outings virtually impossible and certainly less relaxing. As our family holiday was cancelled earlier this year, we have treated ourselves to a night away at an AirBnB cottage about 10 miles from home (Â£117 from savings). We take our favourite takeaway food to reheat that evening and a few bottles to drink - total cost Â£19.99. We spend a relaxing evening re-connecting as adults and taking photos of the starry night before sleeping in a different bed - the only chance we will have do so in 2020. Total spend: Â£594.99 As we've been away for the night, I'm not working on Friday and take the opportunity to get some supermarket shopping out of the way whilst Andrew is at school. We divide our weekly shop between two supermarkets - heavy, bulky or long-dated food, cleaning materials and toiletries are ordered online, but we prefer to select fresh food ourselves. Our online delivery will come Saturday morning and comes in at Â£45.60; the trip to the supermarket today costs Â£50.52, which does include some more batteries for Andrew's toys and a Euromillions lottery ticket. Rik generally visits his brother on Friday nights, it gives him a break from caring for our son and the opportunity to play computer games and discuss the merits of Pink Floyd (!) I spend the evening catching up with soaps and doing laundry. Dinner would normally be a takeaway pizza or kebab but, after the extravagance of our trip away, I decide the wiser choice is a freezer meal with some yellow-stickered new potatoes.  Total spend: Â£96.12 Woohoo, we're millionaires... Not. Maybe we'll have better luck next time. We only buy tickets when the Euromillions prize exceeds Â£75m: our dream is to open an ultra-accessible theme park in the UK, similar to Morgan's Wonderland. The supermarket delivery arrives just after 09:00. Once again, I wonder why I booked an early slot on a day when I don't have to jump out of bed. They cannot supply the self-indulgent cookies I ordered, so we start the day Â£1.00 in credit.  Andrew goes to a disability club on Saturday afternoons, provided by the local Council as part of the Short Break Service. Any organised activity with more than one autistic child can feel rather like trying to herd cats, so the ladies who run the session have my admiration. They always make the effort to mark calendar events, helping the children to make Mother's and Father's Day cards, Halloween masks, and so on. A weekend review of online banking reveals a direct debit on Friday for Â£15.96 for insurance but no other forgotten purchases. I also find that a standing order into my Government Help to Save account hasn't debited - worrying as that impacts the final bonus payment in 2022. A quick check determines that it is my error, I had mistakenly dated the standing order to end in summer 2020 after the first bonus; so I quickly reinstate it. Our other three regular savings accounts - for rainy-day emergencies, for splurges, and for a once-in-a-lifetime family holiday in Florida - are running more smoothly.    Total spend: Â£14.96 Sunday starts with a burst of energy - our local trampoline park runs a specialist ASD/disability session on Sunday morning with no music nor flashing lights (Â£7.50). Andrew loves the physical activity, here he can run and jump around in a safe environment. Because we all have disabled children at the session, parents are more tolerant of trampoline invasions. Another Christmas present is ordered online, this time for Rik's brother - another special offer found on HotUKDeals (Â£22.94). This puts me into a festive mood, so I decide to carry out a stock-take of the contents of our gift cupboard, which is looking quite healthy from various offers found during the year. I can never quite remember what we have, and should probably keep a list; but I do enjoy the surprise of rediscovering what we bought in the spring.  My final seasonal activity for the day is to cut out this year's applique to sew onto Andrew's present sack: every year one more character or feature is added, and we have decided to symbolise 2020 with the Grinch. Andrew is beginning to recognise the Christmas tree and decorations, and to understand that brightly wrapped boxes might contain new toys. However as soon as he has one new toy, he is happy for a while; and opening his presents has been known to take three full days.  Total spend: Â£30.44 Total spent this week: Â£811.14 Autistic episodes/meltdowns = 0 Items broken = 1 (by me) We could save more money if we watched our spending on food more closely, and shopped around; we are choosing to prioritise free time rather than money, which is why most shopping is done online. Time and energy are limited commodities, which we focus on ensuring that our son has the best possible life he can - an education that meets his needs, toys and activities that are stimulating and provide sensory feedback, and making memories.  It is not easy raising a disabled child, we are fortunate that Andrew is - at most times - very happy. Over the next ten years he will become an adult; and I worry about the current lack of appropriate social care for adults with learning disabilities. We are already looking into deputyship to manage his affairs, and a trust fund to protect his money. We will never stop going into battle for him.",2020-11-08T00:32:54,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54795605,2020-11-14 11:16:00.183784,BBC,travel,0
BBC presenters share their lockdown entertainment tips,"With England in lockdown again, and many others parts of the UK enduring severe restrictions, people are looking to film, books, music, online art, podcasts and more for their cultural kicks.  Here, BBC presenters and journalists share their lockdown picks. It's an eclectic list of suggestions for where to look next if you fancy some inspiration. Veteran broadcaster Mark Radcliffe presents BBC Radio 2's Folk Show and 6 Music's weekend chat and music show Radcliffe and Maconie . The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Netflix)  I like a courtroom drama, I must say. For people who don't know the Chicago 7, they were students and hippies and anti-Vietnam protesters who picketed at the 1968 Democratic Party Convention and were arrested for inciting riots. If you remember that year, it was a really highly-charged time. Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, and then Bobby Kennedy in June - so this is an extraordinary snapshot of those times. It still has a resonance, particularly in how the one black defendant is treated. In the time of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd protests, it reminds you that not everything has changed, by a long way. Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador books) This is set in the time of Thatcherism, and it's a tragic tale of this young lad Shuggie Bain, who is protecting and caring for an alcoholic mother, living in extreme poverty. It's rather Thomas Hardy-esque, in that you know everyone is doomed to disappointment or death, but it feels very real. And like the film, one suspects life hasn't changed very much for a lot of people.  The novel is nominated for the Booker Prize, although I don't generally take that as a massive recommendation. I have certainly brought Booker-winning novels and thought they were dreadful. The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Anya Taylor-Joy plays Beth Harman, who's in an orphanage at the beginning of the film, and is intrigued by the janitor who plays chess. He gradually agrees to teach her and it turns out she's an absolute prodigy. It's based on a novel by someone called Walter Tevis but it feels like it ought to be true. It's about the connections you make as an orphan - friendships and connections and adoption. And there's a lot of chess. In fact, we started playing chess at home, inspired by it, and my wife is miles better than me and she can see several moves ahead. We don't play anymore. It got too annoying. The Asian Network presenter has hosted its breakfast show since 2017, having joined the station in 2015 from community radio. Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, iPlayer) Watching my next door neighbour Clara [Amfo] absolutely bossing it on screen is amazing. I'm a huge fan of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing anyway, but seeing Clara shine like a Queen is great. Rooting for her no doubt. And I usually find anything music or dance related to be therapeutic for me. It's fun, an easy watch and it's a great way to wind down. Grab some munchies and sit on the sofa while having your own party. It's perfect. Made In Heaven (Amazon Prime) I've also just finished watching season one of Made In Heaven. A couple of colleagues have been meaning to get me into it and now I'm hooked. It's more of a drama series, but it's so good and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. Can't wait to start the second season. Sister Sister (Netflix) And thirdly, I'm watching Sister Sister, a 1990s US sitcom about twins Tia and Tamera who were separated at birth and reunite 14 years later. It's brought back my youth. And you can never get enough. If you grew up watching Tia and Tamera, you already know how good it is. If you fancy a giggle, put them on.""  DJ Friction has been on the BBC airwaves since 2002, and is now presenting the Asian Network's evening show.  Space videos (YouTube) It's the biggest kind of escapism - forget pandemics, let's talk about 1,000-year journeys to other galaxies. He devours YouTube series by scientists and futurists John Michael Godier and Isaac Arthur, who use science fact to examine what might actually be possible beyond Earth. They'll swing between stuff that's happening in our solar system to real mad stuff like, what will the universe look like a trillion years from now? And then they'll break it down using real physics and real science. The Real Housewives of America (Sky, ITV Be, Amazon Prime Video) I don't watch much TV or reality shows,"" says Friction. ""But I fell into this hole of watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta and The Real Housewives of Potomac. It wasn't until the summer that I went, 'Wait a minute, they're the only two reality shows from that franchise that feature black women. Every other show features white women. I'm subconsciously dealing with Black Lives Matter, race and everything that's happening this year via these reality shows. Believe me, I've fallen so deep into them. Anyone who asks a question about the seasons or the episodes, I have the answer. The Beatles Friction has been rediscovering The Beatles by listening to all their albums back-to-back again. ""I just got back into it and thought, my God, how did these guys write nearly every genre of music that we're still listening to? And you're telling me they released The White Album and Yellow Submarine and Sgt Pepper within the space of 18 months? It's ridiculous."" Will Gompertz has been arts editor for BBC News since 2009 and before that was a director at the Tate Gallery.  What I Love (podcast) I'm loving this podcast, presented by the award-winning theatre director Ian Rickson. It has a simple format: one guest with whom Rickson has worked selects three things he or she loves. Chiwetel Ejiofor included a Michael Kiwanuka song, Kae Tempest picked a book by William Blake. Good listening. Strata: William Smith's Geological Maps (Thames & Hudson) Some books are beautiful, others are enlightening. Strata is both. Packed with exquisite illustrations, it presents the work of William Smith, a 17th Century geologist, who was the first person to comprehensively map the earth beneath our feet. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Call My Agent (Netflix) French TV doesn't get that much attention for some reason - but they produce some great programmes. Spiral is the best police procedural on telly, while Call My Agent is the perfect lockdown escape: uptight actor's agents dealing with uptight actors in a Paris office where they end up either bickering or sleeping with each other. Or both. Tres bon! Musician Hannah Peel presents late-night Radio 3 show Night Tracks, which ranges from classical to contemporary music. She was Emmy-nominated last year for her soundtrack for HBO's Games of Thrones: The Last Watch. Notes On Blindness (Download, Netflix) This is a documentary about the writer John Hull, who went blind just before the birth of his son and started to make a diary of audio cassettes. In the film you hear all the actual recording, and it's just incredible. You're immersed in a world of sound, instead of being totally bombarded with visual information. It sounds like it should be a podcast, but it really works as a film - delving into the mind and the body and dreams and memory. I think it's a masterpiece. Bandcamp (Independent music store) I'm Bandcamp all the way, for everything. They do an amazing thing once a month called Bandcamp Friday, where every artist gets 100% of the profit on their merchandise or downloads or CD sales. It's the only place that does that in the music industry. The last thing I bought was a compilation by a wonderful little indie label called Salmon Universe, who put out a lot of ambient, electronic music. I like compilations because you're led to artists from all across the world, from Ohio to Japan. It's amazing. Islands (RTÃ podcast) This is made by the world-renowned sound recordist Chris Watson, who's teamed up with the writer/presenter Luke Clancy to take a journey across the atlas of remote islands, from Ross Island to the Galapagos to the possibly mythical isle of HyBrasil. It's full of stories and sounds, and it's beautiful. I just like the way you can use podcasts to express something emotional, rather than factual. So you get a sense of ethereal escapism within that. Mark has been the BBC's music reporter since 2015, and presented 6 Music's History of Video Game Music last year. Ted Lasso (Apple TV) After Schitt's Creek ended, I was desperately searching for a TV show that hit the same sweet spot of belly-laughs and heart-warming humour. This is that show. Starring Jason Sudeikis, it tells the story of an American Football coach who comes to London to oversee a fictional Premiership team, despite knowing nothing about football. Unbeknownst to him, the club's owner (played with delicious relish by Hannah Waddingham) is trying to get the team relegated to spite her adulterous husband. I won't spoil the plot, but the show's relentlessly optimistic tone is just what I needed in lockdown. Pikmin 3 Deluxe (Nintendo) Pikmin isn't as well-known as Nintendo's bigger franchises, like Mario and Zelda, but it's been made with just as much care and attention to detail. You play as a crew of astronauts, stranded on a hostile planet, who have to enlist a crop of plant-like creatures to help them find the missing parts of their spaceship. You command up to 100 of the little Pikmin, each of whom have different abilities (some are fighters, some are swimmers, others are impervious to electricity) to solve a bunch of increasingly tricky puzzles against a time limit. It's simultaneously relaxing and panic-inducing; but I've been focusing on completing the less stressful challenge mode with my 10-year-old, who just likes throwing the Pikmin around and laughing at their cute noises. Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia (Warner Music) Rush-released at the start of the first lockdown, this is still my favourite record of the year. A sweat-glistened hymn to the dancefloor, it never fails to lift my mood. The album is getting the live treatment later this month, with a virtual gig that's been dubbed Studio 2054 - with Dua promising (deep breath) ""a kaledioscopic, rocket-fuelled, journey through time, space, mirrorballs, roller discos, bucket hats, belting beats, throbbing basslines and an absolute slam-dunk of the best times in global club culture"". See you there. Hotpants optional. The BBC Radio 3 broadcaster presents late-night show Unclassified, which showcases music by composers who might have a classical background but also draw from pop, rock, jazz, and experimental music. Ms Ice Sandwich by Mieko Kawakami (Pushkin Press) The Japanese author's novella is evocative but breezy, conversational and unsentimental. She's dealing with the difficulties and complexity of human life but in a really relatable, warm and humorous way. It's about the relationship between an adolescent and their mother. It's a coming-of-age tale and about the anxieties of being a teenager, but you get to see it from both sides. You can sense what the mother's feeling as well. She's a fortune teller and their grandma's ill upstairs. It's a family tale about female identity in Japan. Fat Out Fest (YouTube) The annual music festival from Salford-based underground and alternative promoters, Fat Out Fest happened live online this year, and they are now putting sets on YouTube every Friday over the next month. They really do take it to the edge. On 20 November they're broadcasting Lone Taxidermist - her shows are wild. It's performance art as well as music.

How Dolly Parton is 'playing an important role in Covid battle',"A $1m (Â£750,000) donation made by singer Dolly Parton to vaccine research is ""playing an important role in the Covid battle"", US researchers say.  In April, Parton announced she was giving the money to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. That was one of the trial sites for the Moderna vaccine, which is nearly 95% effective, according to early data. A Vanderbilt spokesperson said Parton's ""generous"" gift was helping ""several promising research initiatives"". A portion of the singer's money went towards funding an early stage trial of the Moderna vaccine. Her donation is also supporting a convalescent plasma study and research involving antibody therapies, Vanderbilt University Medical Center spokesperson John Howser said. Convalescent plasma is used to treat people who are battling a Covid infection. ""Her gift provided support for a pilot convalescent plasma study that one of our researchers was able to successfully complete,"" Mr Howser told BBC News. ""Funds from Dolly's gift are also supporting very promising research into monoclonal antibodies that act as a temporary vaccine for Covid. Two of these antibodies are now being tested by a global pharmaceutical firm."" Vanderbilt's plasma pilot showed enough promise for the US NIH (National Institutes of Health) to step in with $34m (Â£26m) in additional support to conduct a national, multi-site clinical trial into the benefits of convalescent plasma. Announcing her donation on Instagram in April, the star said: ""My longtime friend Dr Naji Abumrad, who's been involved in research at Vanderbilt for many years, informed me that they were making some exciting advancements towards that research of the coronavirus for a cure.  ""I am making a donation of $1 million to Vanderbilt towards that research and to encourage people that can afford it to make donations."" A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton) Appearing on NBC's Today Show, the star added: ""What better time right now, we need this. I felt like this was the time for me to open my heart and my hand, and try to help."" Following Parton's gift Jeff Balser, Vanderbilt's president and CEO, said her ""amazing generosity is a source of inspiration"". He added: ""She cares so much about helping others and we are very grateful for her ongoing support. These funds will help us complete promising research that can benefit millions in their battle with the virus."" The Dolly Parton Covid-19 Research Fund was listed among the funders in a preliminary report into the Moderna vaccine that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. After her contribution to the trial was highlighted on Tuesday, fans took to Twitter to praise the Jolene and 9 To 5 singer. Just a moment of profound gratitude to @DollyParton and her COVID-19 Research Fund. Give Dolly Parton the Nobel Peace Prize This week, Moderna suggested its vaccine candidate was highly effective in stopping people getting ill and worked across all age groups. It's said to work in a similar way to the Pfizer and BioNTech candidate that researchers last week declared 90% effective after a separate preliminary trial.

Making the most of a lockdown Diwali,"By Manish PandeyNewsbeat reporter Ask anyone who celebrates Diwali, and they'll tell you it's one of the highlights of the year. Going to the temple, meeting up with family, having delicious food and watching fireworks - what's not to like? But this year, because of coronavirus, things are going to be very different. Lockdown restrictions in England mean it's not possible to meet family members from different households or go to the temple for group worship. But it doesn't mean celebrations this year have to be any less enjoyable. Radio 1 Newsbeat has been finding out how people are planning to still have a fun Diwali. ""The point of Diwali is light over darkness,"" Harish Malhi tells Newsbeat. ""It's one of the few times in the year the entire family comes together. We all dress in new clothes, cook a huge feast and go to the temple."" The 25-year-old Sikh has siblings who live abroad and the pandemic means it's not possible to see them. But he's determined to bring Diwali to them and ""make the most of this situation"". Harish is the founder of Diaspo, an online platform that runs cooking classes, and is using his talents to make sure his family and others in the community can still feel a sense of home. ""Food's always an integral part. So I decided to organise ways to celebrate Diwali online, with traditional cooking classes and creative classes to replicate that feeling of community,"" he says. ""It's so people are transported home and have the smells and tastes they would usually have on Diwali."" Harish thinks this year can still be as enjoyable because it's a positive celebration in a time of difficulty. ""The most beautiful thing is this encourages people from all over the place to come together, eat together, cook together and celebrate together,"" he says. Diwali is the five-day festival of lights, celebrated by millions of Hindus, Sikhs and Jains across the world. This year it started on 12 November, with the main day of celebrations taking place on 14 November. Houses, shops and public places are decorated with small oil lamps called diyas. This Diwali is an opportunity to do something different, according to Francesca Bhavisi. For the 21-year-old Hindu, that has meant taking part in online challenges against other people. ""There's rangoli (traditional Indian decorations) and mithai (sweets)-making competitions."" It's easy to be ""contained within ourselves or our family"" she says. ""But celebrating in this pandemic has meant we can connect to people in ways we never thought would normally be possible."" Francesca will follow the normal routine of prayer and food with her family.  But the chance to connect with new faces and do things she wouldn't normally will make this Diwali ""equally enjoyable"". ""It's like an extra effort making up for things not being normal."" Amandeep Turna will be spending her first Diwali away from her family - making it ""a DIY Diwali"" for her. ""It's one of the two times in the year the whole family gets together, the other being Christmas,"" the 25-year-old Sikh says.  But she's going to use this Diwali to connect further with her faith and the meaning of Diwali - and she'll do that by turning teacher. ""This Covid-friendly Diwali is going to involve me teaching my two non-Diwali celebrating housemates about what the celebration means."" She says it's ""easy to get caught up"" in the food and fireworks and ""forget what Diwali is actually about"". ""If this year has taught us anything, it's to take the small wins. ""There's no way I would've spent time teaching and connecting deeper with Diwali in normal times,"" she adds. She doesn't usually do gifts for her family on Diwali, but this year requires something sweeter - Diwali chocolates made from Indian sweets. ""They'll probably prefer the gift of sweets to the gift of me visiting so hopefully I haven't set myself up for failure for next year,"" she jokes. Dip Lodhiya says the festival ""brings a good spirit"" into people's lives.   A typical Diwali sees a week of cooking, ""cleaning every corner"" of the house and then a day of prayer, seeing family and fireworks. ""Usually you want blessings from your elders but this year I can't exactly say 'can you jump on a quick video call I want some blessings',"" the 23-year-old Hindu says.  But that's no reason to not have an enjoyable Diwali, he says, and for Dip, it will be a mega ""family social"" Zoom with 40 people. There'll be stories from elders, ""the ones when they start and just don't stop"", he laughs. The stories will be supplemented by games such as Countdown and Articulate - with a competitive round of musical bingo full of ""classic Indian songs that everyone can be involved in"". ""And then a singing game called Antakshari, where you're in teams. That works surprisingly well on Zoom,"" he adds. ""It's so important we do this, particularly in a pandemic when we're looking for an excuse to celebrate something."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Trump's legal battles: How six cases may play out,"By Joshua NevettBBC News As president of the United States, Donald Trump enjoyed unique protection from legal action, be it criminal or civil.  Now, after losing the 2020 presidential election, Mr Trump will soon become a private citizen again. That means he will lose his presidential privileges, putting him in the crosshairs of litigators and prosecutors. ""Once he is out of office, the atmosphere will change,"" Daniel R Alonso, a former US federal and New York state prosecutor, told the BBC. ""He will no longer have the reality or the threat of presidential power to thwart investigations."" A wide-ranging criminal investigation in New York is the most serious legal concern for Mr Trump and his real-estate company, the Trump Organization. On top of that, there is an array of lawsuits ranging from allegations of fraud by a family member to sexual harassment by an advice columnist. A legal storm is brewing. Here, we consider how the six biggest legal battles may develop. What we know: Playboy model Karen McDougal, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and claims of a conspiracy of silence. This was the gist of the so-called hush-money scandal. Both women said they had had sexual relationships with Mr Trump and had received payments to keep them quiet ahead of the 2016 presidential election. When they spoke out in 2018, they threw political dynamite under Mr Trump's presidency, lighting the fuse of two criminal investigations. The first focused on violations of federal, or national, laws and the role of Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former personal lawyer and ""fixer"".  Under investigation, Cohen admitted to arranging payments to the two women. The payments were prosecuted as campaign-finance violations and Cohen was sentenced to three years in jail in 2018. Cohen alleged that Mr Trump had ""directed"" him to make the payments yet no charges were brought against the president. Why? Firstly, to charge Mr Trump, prosecutors would have needed to prove that he had indeed directed Cohen to make those payments. Secondly, even if prosecutors did have sufficient evidence to charge Mr Trump, it is against US government policy to indict a sitting president on federal criminal charges, legal experts say. Case closed, right? Well, not exactly. This is where it gets technical. Put simply, a second criminal investigation into the payments is still under way in New York. We know that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is examining whether the Trump Organization falsified business records related to the payoffs. What we don't know is whether Mr Vance has any evidence to file criminal charges. That matters. What might happen next: Falsifying business records is a misdemeanour under New York law. A misdemeanour is a minor crime that can be punishable by a jail term of up to a year. Now, here's the tricky part for Mr Vance. There is a two-year time limit for filing criminal charges for a misdemeanour in New York. ""So, because those payments happened over two years ago, it looks like [prosecutors] are out of luck,"" Mr Alonso said. That said, there are other possibilities.  In New York, falsifying business records can be charged as a felony if it is done to conceal other crimes, such as tax fraud. Felonies are more serious crimes that can be prosecuted over a longer period and are punishable by tougher jail sentences. Still, the route to prosecution is uncertain. It is not clear if Mr Trump can be prosecuted under New York law for campaign-finance violations - the federal crime Cohen was jailed for. This is where the other strands of Mr Vance's investigation come in. What we know: It's a ""political hit job"", a Trump Organization lawyer said of Mr Vance's inquiry in August 2019.  The lawyer's statement was seething. Mr Vance had just issued a request for documents, known as a subpoena. He demanded to see years of financial records, including the Holy Grail - Mr Trump's tax returns, eight years of them. Since then, Mr Trump has tried to block the subpoena, arguing in courts that it amounts to political harassment. In October, a federal appeals court disagreed with Mr Trump, putting his tax returns within touching distance of prosecutors. Indeed, Mr Vance has stressed the significance of Mr Trump's tax returns in court papers. When requesting the tax returns in August, Mr Vance referred to ""public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization"", including allegations of possible insurance and bank fraud. Another court filing in September mentioned tax fraud as a hypothetical crime that could be established, should evidence be found to support it.  In New York, some types of tax fraud can be charged as felonies, which can carry lengthy prison sentences. At the moment, though, the ""public reports"" of possible crimes cited by Mr Vance's office are merely grounds for investigation, nothing else. What might happen next: Mr Trump is expected to appeal against the demand to hand over his tax returns in the Supreme Court. There, the matter may be settled. For Mr Trump, the stakes are high. ""The most significant criminal investigations are those exploring his tax and bank filings,"" Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University, told the BBC. ""But whether there's a criminal case has yet to become evident."" If Mr Vance does obtain Mr Trump's tax returns, a criminal case may or may not become evident. Either way, Mr Vance needs those tax returns to move his investigation forward. What we know: New York Attorney General Letitia James has been another thorn in Mr Trump's side. Since March 2019, Ms James has been leading a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization committed real-estate fraud. Again, the roots of this investigation lead back to Cohen who, in February 2019, told Congress that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his property assets to secure loans and understated them to reduce his taxes. Cohen's testimony gave Ms James grounds to seek information about Mr Trump's property empire. Like Mr Vance, Ms James has had to fight for that information in the courts. Eric Trump, the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and the president's son, has accused her of waging a ""political vendetta"". Despite this, he complied with a request to sit for testimony with her office in October. What might happen next: Ms James needs more testimony and information to take the investigation forward. In office, Mr Trump argued that he was too busy to deal with lawsuits. Now, he cannot use that excuse. Ms James can treat Mr Trump with less deference, pressing him to sit for questioning under oath, just like his son. ""Most courts would be very indulgent with a president-defendant on things like scheduling, for instance. Not so with a private citizen,"" Mr Alonso said. Civil investigations like this can result in financial penalties, if evidence of wrongdoing is found. If it is, another criminal inquiry cannot be ruled out. What we know: Emolument is an archaic word that is seldom used today, except in legal contexts. The definition is contested, but it is generally understood to mean gain, profit or advantage from employment or holding public office. So what does this have to do with Mr Trump?  He has been accused of breaking rules against ""emoluments"" during his presidency. These rules, known as the emoluments clauses, were written into the country's bedrock legal text, the US Constitution. One clause requires all federal officials, including the president, to seek the consent of Congress before accepting any benefits from foreign states. Three separate civil lawsuits alleged that Mr Trump had not sought that consent. One cited the hosting of foreign officials at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC as a possible violation. Mr Trump has berated ""this phony emoluments clause"", suggesting other sitting presidents have made money. What might happen next: Regardless, the emoluments lawsuits will probably be dismissed or dropped, legal experts say. One brought by congressional Democrats has already been rejected by the Supreme Court. ""Emoluments are not likely to be the basis of any criminal action,"" said Mr Turley, an expert on constitutional law. ""The emoluments cases relate to Trump holding office, so once he leaves office, the controversy becomes largely academic. It becomes largely moot."" What we know: Mr Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women whose allegations span decades. Mr Trump has denied all the allegations, dismissing them as ""fake news"", political smears and conspiracies. Many of the accusers came forward ahead of Mr Trump's election win in 2016. Mr Trump vowed to sue them all but, as yet, has not done so. Instead, some of the accusers have sued Mr Trump. Two of those women have filed defamation lawsuits against Mr Trump for calling them liars. E Jean Carroll, a long-time columnist for Elle magazine, is one of them. She has accused Mr Trump of raping her in a dressing room at a luxury Manhattan department store in the 1990s. Mr Trump denies it and is contesting the defamation claim. In her lawsuit, Ms Carroll argues Mr Trump defamed her by saying he could not have raped her because ""she's not my type"". Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a retraction of Mr Trump's statements. Ms Carroll v Mr Trump seemed straightforward enough until September, when the US Department of Justice weighed in. The department took the unusual step of trying to replace Mr Trump with the United States as a defendant in the case. In the end, a federal judge ruled against the department's intervention, arguing ""the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States"". What might happen next: The case can now proceed, allowing Ms Carroll's lawyers to gather evidence.  For example, they could press on by attempting to verify if Mr Trump's DNA is on a dress Ms Carroll says she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault. For that, they would need a DNA sample from Mr Trump. A similar but separate defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr Trump's television show The Apprentice, may go the same way. Ms Zervos alleged that Mr Trump had sexually assaulted her during a meeting to discuss job opportunities at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Mr Trump dismissed the allegation as ""phony"", accusing Ms Zervos of fabricating it for fame. Ms Zervos then sued him for defamation in 2017, seeking damages of at least $3,000. Mr Trump tried to get the case dismissed during his presidency. His lawyers suggested that, as president, he should be immune to lawsuits in state courts. ""That argument completely evaporates on 20 January,"" Barbara L McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan, told the BBC. ""Once that happens we move to the discovery phase of the case and there could be some movement there."" What we know: ""Fraud was not just the family business - it was a way of life,"" reads the first line of Mary Trump's lawsuit against her uncle Donald. As an opening salvo, it could hardly be more contemptuous. It mirrors the animosity of Ms Trump's newly released memoir, in which she chastises her uncle as a ""narcissist"" who threatens the life of every American. The family beef is as personal as it gets and Ms Trump's lawsuit, filed in September, reflects that acrimony. In it, she accuses Mr Trump and two of his siblings of cheating her out of an inheritance while pressuring her to give up interests in the family business. Ms Trump inherited valuable interests in the family business when Fred Trump Jr - her father and the president's older brother - died in 1981 at 42. Ms Trump was 16 at the time. Mr Trump and his siblings ""committed to watch over"" Ms Trump's interests, the lawsuit says.  ""They lied,"" the lawsuit says. ""Rather than protect Mary's interests, they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift [fraud], and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited."" The lawsuit seeks at least $500,000 in damages. What might happen next: The White House said Ms Trump's book was full of ""falsehoods"", but Mr Trump is yet to reply to the lawsuit.  If requests for documents and testimony come, Mr Trump cannot cite his presidential duties as a reason to deny them. No American citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the law.",2020-11-15T23:20:34,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54716550,2020-11-16 08:09:26.738907,BBC,politics,0
Five Covid numbers to watch: Is Scotland turning a corner?,"By Christopher SleightBBC Scotland news First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says recent measures to control Covid-19 have slowed the spread of the virus ""very significantly"". But has Scotland turned a corner in this second wave of the pandemic? Here are five key numbers to watch.  Across the whole of Scotland, the average number of new cases every day is no longer rising. The figure appears to have peaked towards the end of October and has now stabilised following a drop in levels at the beginning of November. However, there are still significant areas of Scotland where cases are on the rise - and this is causing concern for the Scottish government as it attempts to slow the spread of the virus. On Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon said Angus, Fife and Perth and Kinross would be moving from Level 2 to Level 3 under the new five-tier system, partly because of the sharp rise in cases in recent days. Other local authorities have also seen big rises in the weekly rate per 100,000 people since the beginning of November. In Inverclyde, the rate of new cases more than doubled in the week up to 6 November, and the case rate in Stirling went from 77 to 139 over the same period. Finally, rates in Glasgow show no sign of going down, despite being under some form of extra restrictions since 1 September. On 7 November, rates in the city had been above the Scottish government's Level 4 threshold of 300 cases per 100,000 people for five days. Infection rates are not the only measure the Scottish government uses to review levels - but clearly the corner has not been turned in these local hotspots where cases are still rising. The daily number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 is an important statistic - but it is difficult to make a comparison between now and March using this figure as the number of people being tested has risen so significantly.  One number that is arguably a better gauge of where Scotland is in its second wave is hospital admissions. The daily admissions for Covid-19 in Scotland hit a low in mid-July. Since then it has mainly been going up, but the latest figures show that, by this measure, a corner has been turned. If the decline is sustained, the peak will also have been significantly lower than in the spring. But it is also worth examining local hospital capacity for Covid-19 patients, which is another of the Scottish government's ""indicators"" for its five-level system. According to the government's indicators paper, some health boards have already exceeded their capacity for Covid-19 patients. The sickest Covid-19 patients are likely to end up in intensive care, where the mortality rate is high. A report by Public Health Scotland published in July found that almost 40% of patients died within 30 days of being admitted to intensive care. The number of daily ICU admissions has been rising steadily since the end of the summer - there were six Covid-19 patients in intensive care on 11 September and there were 111 on 8 November. However, daily admissions now appear to have reached a plateau. They are not obviously in decline like hospital admissions, but the latest figures show they are not rising either. The Scottish government announces daily figures of deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. Scotland went 40 days over the summer with no deaths recorded at all using this measure. Currently, the average number of new Covid-19 deaths being registered each day is lower than the peak in April, but the figure is increasing and shows no sign of slowing yet. The National Records of Scotland count all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. A similar pattern is evident with this measure - the number of deaths per week is far lower than the peak in the spring, but is still rising. It appears that hospital and ICU admissions may peak at a much lower rate than they did in the spring - so why is that when the number of new cases has undoubtedly surged in the past two months? One reason could be that fewer over-65s are being infected now than they were in the early stages of Scotland's pandemic. Younger age groups are much less likely to end up in hospital, or die, from Covid-19. This chart shows that the highest rate of infections since 1 August has been among 15 to 24 year olds, with that steep rise in mid-September driven by outbreaks in student accommodation. However, infection rates among older age groups have been rising in recent weeks. So this is a number worth watching: if older age groups continue to become infected in large numbers, then hospital and ICU admissions could begin to go up again.",2020-11-12T12:17:44,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-54535938,2020-11-13 14:42:39.042734,BBC,politics,0
EasyJet slumps to first annual loss amid pandemic,"EasyJet has reported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history as the coronavirus crisis continues to affect the travel industry deeply. The airline posted a loss of Â£1.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet added that it expected to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. The pandemic has hit airlines hard, with lockdowns and restrictions cutting the number of people travelling. However, EasyJet welcomed the possibility of a Covid-19 vaccine being rolled out, and said underlying demand was strong for air travel. Chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said that the recent developments on Covid vaccines ""certainly is good news, because we know that is going to be a very critical part of the recovery"". ""But I don't think it's only about the vaccine, I think it's also about the fact that we need to have testing in place, we need to have also refined development of the quarantine system,"" he added. ""We know that people want to travel. On the news of the vaccine last Monday, bookings were up close to 50%, so it just gives evidence to the fact that any good news that comes out of here makes people more confident making bookings going forward."" EasyJet's revenues plunged due to government travel restrictions in most of its markets, the airline said. These included full national lockdowns, which led the airline to ground its entire fleet for 11 weeks. There was some recovery in demand in the summer as lockdowns were eased, but widespread quarantine restrictions in September once again eroded demand, it said. EasyJet has been making use of UK government support, borrowing Â£600m in April. The airline said on Tuesday that after talks with the Bank of England and the Treasury, it would extend its borrowing under the government Corporate Finance Facility scheme, and stagger repayments.",2020-11-17T08:09:37,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54970784,2020-11-17 09:52:31.120262,BBC,travel,0
Covid-19: Heart deaths increase and testing for care home visitors,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Saturday morning. We'll have another update for you on Sunday morning. Almost 5,000 more people have died from heart problems in England than would be expected since the start of the pandemic, the British Heart Foundation has warned. Analysis by the charity found excess deaths are 7% above predicted levels. The charity is urging people not to delay checks or treatment during the second wave of the virus, while NHS England says hospitals are redesigning services so that care can go ahead safely. Despite this week's vaccine breakthrough, the UK is going to be wresting with Covid for some time yet, says our health correspondent Nick Triggle. The UK has become the first European country to pass the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths and we've see a record rise in new cases - both are a clear reminder that there are many more difficult days to come. More lockdowns, more isolating? Nick looks at what's in store. People visiting relatives and friends in care homes will be able to access regular coronavirus testing as part of a trial, says the government. A new pilot in England will see screening rolled out across 20 care homes in Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall, with other regions expected to see regular tests before Christmas. Tests for one family member or friend for each resident could end restrictions on visits, when used with other measures such as face coverings. Every year, Leicester's Golden Mile - the city's length of road famous for its South Asian connections - becomes a noisy, joyous mass of colour and light as residents and visitors from around the world celebrate Diwali. ""Normally all the shops have decorations and signs up in their windows,"" Joshna Ramji, 62, said. ""It's full of people buying gifts, food, new clothes or getting their hair done. But this year nobody is doing that. The atmosphere is very different."" Undeterred, our Radio 1 Newsbeat colleagues have been finding out how people are planning to still have a fun Diwali. Thoughts of digging out the baubles may be a way off for some, but not for Paul Fenning, from Doncaster.

Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin hits three-year high as investors jump in,"By Justin HarperBusiness reporter, BBC News Bitcoin, the world's best-known cryptocurrency, has jumped above $17,000 (Â£12,800) to hit a three-year high. The digital currency has suffered plenty of wild price swings since it was launched in 2009. But investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies during the pandemic-driven volatility on global stock markets. However, experts have cautioned about viewing them as a ""safe haven"". On Wednesday, Bitcoin had climbed more than 7% to $17,891, its highest level since December 2017. Some analysts said the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged investors to reassess the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there are still concerns about the fraudulent trading in cryptocurrencies following a succession of high-profile hacks. During times of volatility, investors tend to move their money out of shares and into what are considered safer havens, like cash and gold. Some feel cryptocurrencies are now being viewed as a shelter from stock market volatility. ""Covid-19 has disrupted the traditional safe-haven trade and gold's inability to outperform. Periods of extreme risk aversion have forced many traders to diversify into Bitcoin,"" said Edward Moya, at trading firm Oanda. One attraction of Bitcoin is its limited supply, which is capped at 21 million. Some feel this scarcity provides an innate value and shields Bitcoin from inflation, which is becoming a worry. But Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, warned about jumping into Bitcoin. ""Its huge volatility hardly makes it a safe haven as a store of value. I have far more confidence in the $50 note in my wallet retaining its value over time than Bitcoin, which seems to bounce around like a yo-yo."" Last month, PayPal announced that its customers will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies using their PayPal accounts, allowing customers to buy things from the 26 million sellers which accept PayPal, it said. PayPal plans to roll out buying options in the US over the next few weeks, with the full rollout due early next year. But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility. ""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""   Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).  ""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver. ""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" China is one such country working towards launching its own government-backed digital currency - known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). One trader, Jon Son, told the BBC: ""I think more people are beginning to buy Bitcoin first not to miss the rise and then research into what exactly Bitcoin is.""",2020-11-18T03:30:05,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54982604,2020-11-18 08:19:35.525010,BBC,financial,0
Brexit: Will Scottish fishing boats move to Northern Ireland?,"By Chris Morris & Oliver BarnesBBC Reality Check Most of the fishing that takes place close to the west coast of Scotland is for shellfish, and most of the catch is exported to Europe. But an industry that is already struggling because demand has dried up during the Covid-19 pandemic is now facing the prospect of no trade deal between the UK and the EU.  That would lead to tariffs (or taxes) on goods traded between them - making the produce of some Scottish fishermen too expensive for European customers. All the more so because their close neighbours will be treated differently, under terms set out in the Brexit withdrawal agreement.   Whatever happens in the final weeks of post-Brexit trade talks, Northern Ireland will have easier access to the EU economy next year than the rest of the UK.  Businesses based on land can't do much about that, unless they move lock, stock and barrel. But what about those who ply their trade at sea? Could some Scottish fishermen continue to fish in the same waters, but re-register their boats in Northern Ireland?  ""Tariffs would have a devastating impact on all the shellfish producers,"" says Duncan MacInnes of the Western Isles Fishermen's Association, ""and would certainly make some of them unviable in the current climate.""  Boats from Scotland and Northern Ireland fish side-by-side in these waters.  But deal or no deal, Northern Ireland will continue to follow most of the rules of the EU single market after the rest of the UK leaves at the end of the year.  That will allow its fishermen to continue exporting, either across the land border into the Republic of Ireland (which is in the EU) or straight to continental Europe, without new costs or bureaucracy. And it means some Scottish skippers could be tempted to re-register their boats in Northern Irish ports. ""Undoubtedly, if that was the only thing that could possibly keep the business viable, then 100%,"" says Tommy Finn from the Clyde Fishermen's Association. ""It's important to remember too that while we land our catches on the west coast of Scotland, I would say 80%, possibly, is processed in Northern Ireland at the minute, and then exported. ""So, if it meant our businesses being viable, then for sure we would have to think about registering our boats in Northern Ireland.""   The devolved governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland both told us that in theory it was feasible, although neither was enthused by the idea.  They emphasised that fishermen could only re-register their boats in another part of the UK if a vessel ""genuinely moves its place of operation"", and if it works out of the port it is registered to.  For some species of fish, there would also be issues about the allocation of quota, which is divided up between the four nations of the UK. And the authorities in Northern Ireland warned they would not issue a licence ""if the sole purpose of getting one was to take advantage of perceived benefits arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol"".  But the agreement (or concordat) that governs relations between the four UK national fisheries administrations says specifically that vessels are free to move between them, if they really do change their home port. And the basics of switching registration can be done in a matter of days by boats from anywhere in the UK. ""You simply change the port letters and numbers at the ships' registry,"" explains Andrew Oliver, a marine and fisheries lawyer based in Hull. ""You have to certify that the new number is painted on the vessel... it's actually all relatively simple.""  In some ports on the west coast of Scotland, the incentive to try something new could be strong.  Even if there is a trade deal with the EU and there are no tariffs, an industry that has to ship much of its produce either live or incredibly fresh will have to deal with new bureaucracy.  That includes catch certificates, health certificates and export forms, all of which will take up more time and create more costs for businesses that work on tight margins.  ""You often have hauliers who are picking up small batches from different fishing areas,"" says Philippa Whitford, the Scottish National Party MP for central Ayrshire. ""If any one of those loads doesn't have the right paperwork, the entire lorry could be set aside and not go through (into the EU)."" That could mean local fishermen will be casting envious glances at their counterparts just across the water. ""They'll be able to able to land into Northern Ireland and, as far as we understand it, largely directly into the EU single market, without tariffs, and without the same bureaucracy,"" Ms Whitford adds. If that does create a big economic disadvantage in Scotland, local fishermen say they will have to look after their own interests.  It's nothing new to register companies in other states to overcome rules and regulations,"" says Duncan MacInnes. ""So, businesses will do anything that is legitimate."" The government says the detail of how the Northern Ireland Protocol will work in practice is still being negotiated in a joint committee with the EU.   It also insists that taking back control of British fishing waters will be one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, and many fishing communities enthusiastically agree.  But not all of them.  Like many things to do with Brexit, fishing is more complicated than it first appears.

Ethiopia Tigray crisis: UN warns 'war crimes' may have happened,"Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN has warned. The UN human rights chief has called for an inquiry into reports that up to hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused fighters from the Tigray People's Liberation Front of the massacre.  Tigrayan officials have denied involvement in the atrocities. Mr Abiy said that TPLF fighters went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray. Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International. If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out last week. Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down. Ms  Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities. There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces. As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.  The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"". It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from. It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. By Hana Zeratsyon,BBC Tigrinya Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.  There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed. In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders. On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region. I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.  I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.  As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.  Read more about life in Tigray Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of TPLF. ""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.  Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heartbreaking"".  Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership. His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials. The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains. Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray. As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well. However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by Mr Abiy.   Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted. The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country. Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.  Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.  Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked. For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority. There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region. The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme. The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.  This cannot be achieved without the co-operation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.  Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling Eritrea's, during their attack on the federal army base, to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".   Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.",2020-11-13T12:56:36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-54929100,2020-11-13 14:25:39.144817,BBC,world,0
Christmas cards 'even more poignant' this year,"By Howard MustoeBusiness reporter As with many stores, specialist greetings card shops have been told to close during lockdown, cutting their usual seven-week Christmas sales period down to three. While cards, like everything else, can be bought online, more than 90% are still sold in shops in the UK. With non-essential shops in England due to reopen from 2 December, will there be a rush to buy cards? Or will we keep in touch in other ways? Lindsey Nathan started the One More Card campaign in 2017 to encourage children to write to a lonely older neighbour or relative. She was inspired by a friend who asked strangers to send Christmas cards to isolated World War Two veteran Harry Winters. As well as asking them to write an extra card, she toured schools to show children how to start a conversation with an older member of their community, and encouraged visits to care homes.  ""This year it will be very different because we can't do that,"" she says. ""But actually it's even more poignant,"" she says. ""We all know now what it feels like to be lonely and isolated because we've all been put in that situation this year.  ""It's hard and it's a struggle. I think everybody, people who are working-age who have perhaps never known it before, and children understand it too."" The UK card industry made sales of about Â£1.7bn last year, according to the Greeting Card Association lobby group, which estimates that the British send almost a billion Christmas cards a year, more per person than any other nation.  The attraction of sending and receiving cards is multifaceted, says Emma Bache, a handwriting expert and the author of handwriting guide Reading Between the Lines. ""The very act of putting pen to paper is very personal,"" she says. ""It shows that an individual has taken enough care and enough thought. The much slower process of hand writing a card is much more intimate and more thoughtful. ""It brings joy to the recipient. Most of what we see in the post these days are bills or other unwanted mail. It's a little bit of character, a little bit of love, especially now. ""I'm hoping actually if people have more time on their hands, it will be a lovely thought that more will be sent."" While specialist card shops are closed, cards can be purchased at supermarkets and other general stores, and online. But specialist card retailers account for about 60% of the market. John Procter, founder of High Street chain Scribbler, says some sales have shifted online, but not enough to make up for a 50% drop in custom during the pandemic compared with a year ago. He's upbeat about his industry in general though, especially as people are barred from meeting and are rediscovering cards as ways to connect.  ""What's great is people are reverting to buying cards because it's a physical manifestation, and the thing about it is handwriting. When you see something that's handwritten, it's as close as you are going to get to seeing someone."" But he also thinks fewer Christmas cards might be bought this year.  Being forced to shut down in November means people will have three weeks from 2 December to buy their cards in store, which raises concerns for him about accommodating the number of expected customers in a socially distanced way. Most card shops are quite small, he says. That's one of the reasons he'd like the government to consider his shops as essential. ""It's going to reduce the flow of people, reduce that pressure,"" he says. Unsurprisingly, online stores like Moonpig have seen a rise in Christmas card sales compared with last year.  ""We've seen a significant increase in customer demand since lockdown, with people using greeting cards as a way to stay in touch with their loved ones,"" the company told the BBC. ""We've sold a lot more Christmas cards at this stage in November than we had last year."" But for anyone sending cards, there are other options than buying them ready-made. People with time on their hands may opt for the personal touch, says Lindsey Nathan, the campaigner. Children, especially, have found creative outlets while being stuck at home. ""All of the children, if you look how they've adapted, they've drawn rainbow pictures in the window, pictures for pumpkin trails at Halloween.  ""Kids need things to do, we are in a second lockdown. Let's make Christmas cards. Let's think about who we have in the neighbourhood and hand deliver them. ""Write something about how they found lockdown or what their year has been like. I think the pandemic has been awful but the thing we can take from it is it's brought people together.""",2020-11-15T01:31:09,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54894771,2020-11-15 16:20:19.213124,BBC,world,1
Topshop owner in talks to secure Â£30m lifeline,"Topshop owner Arcadia is in talks with lenders to secure around Â£30m in funding following the second coronavirus lockdown in England. The discussions, revealed by Sky News, are understood to be progressing and a deal could be close to being reached. Another report suggested that Arcadia is drawing up plans to place the business into administration.   But the company said: ""It is not true that administrators are about to be appointed."" ""Clearly, the second UK lockdown presents a further challenge for all retailers and we are taking all appropriate steps to protect our employees and other stakeholders from its consequences."" It is understood that Arcadia - led by Sir Philip Green - has contingency plans in place regarding the future of the business but there is confidence it will secure financing to continue trading. As well as Topshop, the group also owns the chains Topman, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton and Dorothy Perkins. Non-essential retailers in England have been forced to close for four weeks until 2 December to contain the spread of the coronavirus. During the first country-wide lockdown, Arcadia furloughed the vast majority of its 15,000-strong workforce across more than 500 outlets. Staff at its shops in England have been placed back on the government's wage subsidy scheme though its stores in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have now reopened. Arcadia said: ""We are continuing to trade online through our own channels as well as through those of our partners."" However, Debenhams, a major Arcadia partner which sells a number of its brands, is facing its own challenges. The department store chain is in administration and is in talks to find a buyer. Arcadia underwent restructuring last year through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). It agreed to shut 50 shops, secured a rent cut with landlords on property and struck a deal with the Pension Protection Fund to put money into the company's pension schemes.  At the time, the pension scheme deficit was estimated to be around Â£700m but the Sunday Times reported it is now Â£350m on a buyout basis.  In a deal with the Pensions Regulator, trustees of Arcadia's pension schemes were granted security over Â£210m worth of assets by the company. Sir Philip's wife, Lady Cristina Green, who is Arcadia's biggest shareholder, agreed to pump Â£100m into the schemes over three years while Arcadia said it would inject a further Â£75m. Sir Philip faced controversy over the pension scheme at one of his other businesses, BHS, which he sold to Dominic Chappell for Â£1 in 2015. BHS collapsed a year later, with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. More recently, Chappell was sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of tax evasion.

"Covid-19: PM self-isolating, 'mega labs' and small firms court case","Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. After a tumultuous few days at Number 10 - in which two of his closest advisers left under a cloud - Boris Johnson had been hoping to hit the reset button. He'll now have to do that while staying at home after coming into contact with an MP who tested positive for coronavirus. Downing Street says key meetings will go ahead, albeit remotely, including on spending plans and lifting the lockdown in England. The PM also has big decisions to make on Brexit. Mr Johnson, who was very ill with Covid-19 earlier this year, said he was feeling ""fine"", but ""the rules are the rules"".  The government says the facilities will double the UK's daily virus testing capacity, using technology to get results quicker and at lower cost. We're told they'll open in ""early 2021"" in Leamington Spa and at another unconfirmed site in Scotland, and will also be used to process tests for other illnesses including cancer. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says the time frame for opening is vague, though. Meanwhile - as another major vaccine trial begins in the UK - Labour is calling for a national plan to roll out a jab soon as one is ready. Find out when that could be.  The UK's highest court will begin hearing a test case later to decide whether insurance companies should cover businesses for losses they incurred during the first UK-wide lockdown. Thousands of small firms believe they should receive money, but insurers say their policies were never intended to cover such unprecedented restrictions. The issue will have had implications for 370,000 businesses, and involves potential payouts of Â£1.2bn. Hear from some of those affected. A report is warning that widespread working from home could lead to an increase in racism and prejudice. The Woolf Institute, which researches interfaith relations, says workplace friendships are key to breaking down misconceptions and normalising diversity, and without them there's a risk people will go ""back into isolated silos"". Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, and Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, told us how they became friends as well as colleagues. Like all schools, Morchard Bishop primary in Devon was struggling to fundraise through its traditional events this year due to the pandemic. Not to be beaten though, staff and pupils came up with a plan - a socially-distanced safari trail around the village. Lots of households and businesses took part - think meerkats on the lawn, tarantulas at the playground gate - and so far the school has raised Â£250.

New Zealand Police introduce hijab to uniform,"New Zealand Police have introduced a hijab into their official uniform to encourage more Muslim women to join. New recruit Constable Zeena Ali will become the first officer to wear the official hijab. A spokesperson said they aimed to create an ""inclusive"" service reflecting the country's ""diverse community"". Other forces such as the Metropolitan Police in London and Police Scotland offer the option of a uniform hijab. In the UK, the Metropolitan Police in London approved a uniform hijab in 2006 with Police Scotland following in 2016. In Australia, Maha Sukkar of Victoria Police wore a hijab in 2004.  New Zealand Police said work to develop the hijab for its uniform began in late 2018 in response to a request from police staff who visited secondary schools.

Duke's birthday wishes for Prince Charles,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have wished Prince Charles a very happy birthday on their official social media accounts, as he turns 72. The message, posted on Twitter and Instagram, appears alongside a picture of a smiling Charles. Normally, the heir to the throne's birthday is celebrated with gun salutes in Green Park, the Tower of London and in other parts of the country. However, ceremonial gunfire has been suspended amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The prince's birthday comes near the end of an eventful year. In March, he contracted coronavirus and travelled to Scotland to self-isolate for seven days after displaying mild symptoms. At the time, the Duchess of Cornwall tested negative for the virus and self-isolated for 14 days. The Prince of Wales later said he ""got away with it quite lightly"". Earlier this month, palace sources told the BBC Prince William had also tested positive for Covid-19 at a similar time to his father.

True crime: Did the right man hang for murder in 1933?,"By Gordon AdairBBC News NI  In the summer of 1932, little Nora Symington had scarlet fever.  Now in her 90s, her memory of that time remains crystal clear. An ambulance was lurching along the Symingtons' Lane, taking Nora and her mother to hospital. Nora recalls: ""I sat up and looked out. And I said: 'Mummy, there are policemen ripping up the bushes.'  ""Then the nurse said: 'Oh, haven't you heard? There's been a murder.'"" Nearly 90 years later, questions and rumours still surround the killing. The victim, it would emerge, was a 23-year-old domestic servant called Minnie Reid. A post-mortem examination revealed she was about eight months pregnant.  Harold Courtney, also 23 and a lorry driver from Dungannon, was thought to be the father.  He was engaged to another woman and quickly became the prime suspect.  He was arrested, tried twice and eventually found guilty. He was hanged in Crumlin Road Gaol in Belfast in April 1933. At least, that's what the official story says. Minnie's body was found by Nora's young cousins. They were playing in the lane as the outbreak of scarlet fever meant they couldn't play inside.  About 25 years ago, when I was a young reporter in the Portadown Times, I met one of the children, by then quite an elderly man.  He suggested to me that there was more to this than met the eye. But the relentless nature of day-to-day news meant it got pushed to the back of my mind for many years.  Much more recently, health problems led to a change of role for me within the BBC and provided the opportunity to revisit this story.  The result has been an unexpected, challenging, strange - perhaps even bizarre - investigation stretching from rural County Armagh in the 1930s to the melting pot of Melbourne, Australia, in the 1960s. Along with my producer, Ophelia Byrne, I've gained access to 'secret' files which were to have stayed closed until 2034, 100 years after the Harold Courtney hanging.  We've consulted experts in subjects from pathology to handwriting, policing to capital punishment.  We've found eye witnesses - children at the time, now in their 90s - uncovered letters that seem to provide a telling insight into what was going on between Harold and Minnie, but yet were never introduced as evidence in the court case.  Other potential exhibits were literally buried. I've been told of a witness to the execution who was effectively traumatised into his own grave, of mysterious visitors as recently as four or five years ago who travelled from Australia to see the spot where Minnie's body was found. Of threats, of a bonfire of research notes and of the alleged power of secretive organisations in the fledgling Northern Ireland of the 1930s. The result is a six-part series called Did The Right Man Hang?  It will kick off a new podcast slot from BBC Northern Ireland - Assume Nothing - where events, previously accepted as factual, are re-interrogated.  Reporting teams - as the name suggests - assume nothing as they dig out old records and try to create fresh leads to find out what really happened. Did the Right Man Hang? begins on Radio Ulster at 12:00 GMT on Saturday, 14 November, and will be available on BBC Sounds from the same time.",2020-11-13T06:56:48,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-54918746,2020-11-15 16:22:19.814101,BBC,world,0
Yorkshire Ripper killings created 'culture of fear',"By Oliver WrightBBC News Leeds in the late 1970s and early 1980s was a place of fear and suspicion as the hunt for one of Britain's most prolific killers dominated the city. Peter Sutcliffe, later dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper, killed 13 women and attacked at least eight more between October 1975 and November 1980. Six of the Ripper's victims were attacked in Leeds during a five-year period, and as the killings continued and the manhunt dragged on, every woman became a possible target and every man a potential suspect. Between October 1975 and June 1977 Sutcliffe, who has died aged 74, killed Wilma McCann, 28, Emily Jackson, 42, Irene Richardson, 28 and 16 year-old Jayne McDonald in the Chapeltown area of Leeds -  a fifth woman, Patricia Atkinson, had been killed in Bradford. Ruth Bundey, a solicitor who lived in Chapeltown at the time and who later went on to represent some of the Ripper's victims, said the killings brought fear and suspicion to the city. Speaking in the 2019 documentary series 'The Yorkshire Ripper Files: A Very British Crime Story' she said: ""[There was] fear in the homes of ordinary people.  ""Suspicion, looking at one's neighbours and thinking 'Could it be him?'.  ""Anybody who had a car dropping a woman home would wait until you had seen the woman get up to her front door, go in and put the light on. And you wouldn't go away until that had happened."" Peter McGoldrick, now 63, was studying chemistry at the University of Leeds between 1976 and 1980.  He said that in his first year he was aware of the killings but became more observant in his second year when he moved to the Hyde Park area of Leeds - less than two miles west of Chapeltown. ""I can recall vividly, and certainly in the winter months, there was a lot of concern amongst the female population at the university,"" he said. ""The nights were getting short and it was a particularly dark walk from the university across Woodhouse Moor [towards Hyde Park]. ""I remember meeting girls that I did not know asking me if I would walk with them across the park until they got to the other side. ""That was a common thing across the student population, you would not hesitate to offer someone an escort."" Police wrongly believed to begin with the murders were a result of the killer's hatred of prostitution as they were centred around the city's notorious red light district. But as the killings continued and spread across West Yorkshire and into Manchester the background of his victims seemed no longer to be the key. In April 1979 Josephine Whitaker, a 19-year-old building society clerk, was found dead on Savile Park Moor in Halifax - she was the Ripper's 10th victim. Her murder is seen by some as a tipping point, when many more women began to fear for their lives. ""Prior to the Josephine Whittaker murder people had felt that he was only targeting women that were prostitutes or sex workers,"" said former Ripper Squad detective Bob Bridgestock. ""But, after her death that changed, nobody was safe, no female was safe. It created mass hysteria. ""People used to say they wouldn't go out any more until he was caught, they daren't. He had created a culture of fear."" Diana Muir was a junior reporter on the Yorkshire Evening Post in 1978 - her first job after graduating. ""People were scared, there's no doubt about it,"" she said. ""The biggest jolt to that was when he killed [Josephine Whittaker]. ""Chapeltown was notorious, it was the red light district for Leeds at that time and I suppose it was thought if you were in that area you were taking a risk, but it was quite clear after the attack in Halifax that it was nothing to do with that."" The Ripper killings also brought the finger of suspicion to Leeds and the fear the killer was living among them. ""Everybody wanted him caught,"" recalled Mr Bridgestock. ""People were saying look at your brother, your father, your uncle is this the person that might be the Ripper?"" Mr Goldrick said one of his housemates had been interviewed by police after his car was identified as one of thousands with the same tyre markings linked to a track found at one of the murder scenes. Mrs Muir said a colleague was taken in due to a resemblance to a police drawing of the potential suspect. Over the course of five years West Yorkshire Police interviewed thousands of men while the terror and suspicion lingered over Leeds. However, that culture of fear came to an end in January 1981 when Sutcliffe was arrested in Sheffield and quickly handed over to the Ripper squad. He was charged three days later and when he appeared at Dewsbury Magistrates' Court the fear that had held sway over Leeds and the north of England erupted. On the day of his court appearance hundreds of people lined the streets shouting, jeering and jostling for a chance to see the man who had cast his shadow over their lives for so long. Less than six months later Sutcliffe had been convicted of 13 counts of murder and attempting to murder seven more. He was given 20 life sentences. With his arrest and conviction the grim spectre of fear which had hung over Leeds for so long was lifted, leaving its residents safe to walk the streets once more and able to sleep a little easier. Mrs Muir, who left the local newspaper in 1988 but still lives in the city, said: ""Leeds is unrecognisable. It's almost like if you think back to that time the city was in black and white. ""There are many young people who live here now who do not really know the story, it's gone and Leeds has reinvented itself.""",2020-11-13T11:23:19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-54894311,2020-11-13 14:33:08.919478,BBC,world,0
Turnip Prize 2020: Finalists for spoof art award unveiled,"A padlock on a bed of duck feathers and a pile of fur are among the finalists of a spoof art competition that pokes fun at the Turner Prize.  Lockdown and Fur Load are two of the six finalists of 2020's Turnip Prize.  The award, organised by a Somerset pub, is given to the person who has ""created something they perceive to be crap art using the least amount of effort possible"".  The winner will be unveiled online on 1 December.  Organiser Trevor Prideaux, of The New Inn in Wedmore, said 120 people had entered the competition, crossing the 100 mark for the second successive year.  ""This year we have received a record number of entries. We have ordered a second skip,"" he said. The prize was first given out in 1999 in response to Tracey Emin's My Bed, which was shortlisted for the Turner Prize that year. Winners of the competition receive a turnip attached to a wooden base.  A pair of knickers with a burnt hole in the front won the prize last year. Bush Fire Down Under claimed top honours, with its artist dedicating the win to a koala who died in the Australian bushfires. Other past winners include a plastic dog on a plate of jelly, called Collywobbles, and a toy tractor pulling a plastic pig, entitled Pulled Pork.

"Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus?","By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Record numbers of Covid-19 cases are being confirmed across the UK. But given it's also the flu season, how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu? They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms. Most people who feel ill with coronavirus will have at least one of these three key symptoms: So what do you need to know about other things you may catch in the coming months?  A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.  It is best to use a thermometer to take a measure. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back.  Although fever is a key coronavirus symptom, it could be flu or a different infection.  A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.  If you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online. If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms.  Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold. Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare. A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or ""episodes"" in 24 hours.  If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual.  You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough.  These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test.  It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus. Sneezing is not a symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test.  Sneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands.  Remember Hands. Face. Space to help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses: More people in England are being offered a free flu jab this year too in the run-up to winter.  As we head into winter and with children back to school and more workplaces open, lots of people will be getting colds.  A runny nose is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland. Data from an app that has been monitoring Covid-19 symptoms, reported by UK users, suggests children present less often with respiratory symptoms and are more likely to be suffering from fever, headaches, fatigue and skin rashes. People with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, although some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.  Symptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five. Feeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection. If you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service. If you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999. And the NHS advises: ",2020-11-12T17:49:15,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54145299,2020-11-13 14:43:54.817154,BBC,travel,0
Entertainers find new ways to pay the bills,"By Suzanne Bearne Technology of Business reporter Like many celebrities fitness instructor Derrick Evans, better known as Mr Motivator, saw his work schedule fall apart when the coronavirus lockdown hit the UK. ""In March everything got cancelled,"" he says. ""Sales conferences - where I'm brought in at 1:30pm when everyone's had too much to eat and drink and my job is to make people feel good and important - all got cancelled, as did 14 festivals I was due at."" But, ever the optimist, he says he ""believed new opportunities would come along."" And so they did, with Evans, 68, admitting ""he's never been busier"". There have been appearances on BBC One, donation-led exercise classes several times a week on Zoom, while companies such as Google have booked him in for morale-boosting talks and exercise sessions through the video channel. But there's another way he is carving out his time, and that is through making personalised video messages for his fans via video platform Hidols, which launched in July and has snooker player John Virgo and actress Linda Lusardi on its books. He charges Â£30 for a 30-second video, although he says it's often for longer. ""I don't charge what others charge,"" he says. ""It's not that critical. I want to make people feel good. That's been the driver.""  He won't reveal how many requests or bookings he has received but says it's ""quite a few"" a month. Embracing the task, he says he likes to devote time and energy to them.  ""I edit them, put music on them, add a little message. I just did a shout-out to a gym opening, someone celebrating their 60th, someone 100 years old. It's lovely. People want cheering and motivating."" With many of their usual avenues closed, in the UK alone the live music industry is set to see revenues this year fall by 81%, and celebrities are turning to online to make ends meet. ""For celebrities [sending video messages] is a way to supplement their income,"" says Christian Ayerst, chief executive and co-founder of Hidols. ""They can earn Â£10,000 a year-plus by doing 40 a month."" But there are other benefits, he says. ""It's a genuine chance to interact with fans."" The most popular celebrity shout-out service is US-based Cameo, which launched in 2016 and counts Snoop Dogg, Chaka Khan and Lennox Lewis among its celebs.  While the average cost of a video is $60 (Â£45), the most expensive is former athlete and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, who will provide a tailored video message for a cool $2,500 (Â£1,875). More Technology of Business ""We have tens of thousands of celebs on the platform,"" says Cameo co-founder Martin Blencowe.  ""All we're trying to do is find someone's favourite person. We have all gone through tough times and it's a way to add a bit of magic to the day."" Coronavirus led to an upsurge in celebs joining the platform. ""Participation blew up because now movies are cancelled, TV shows and gigs are cancelled, concerts are cancelled,"" he says.  ""They're looking for a new revenue stream. They're doing it for part entertainment, part business. It's a great way to connect [with fans]. We saw over 1,000% growth [over lockdown].""  New celebs who joined included actors Tom Hopper, John Cleese and Dick Van Dyke. Celebs set their own price and sometimes adjust to meet demand. Hidols takes a 25% cut. Entertainers with their own channels have an advantage. Singer Melissa Etheridge is bringing in over $50,000 a month through a subscription business where she puts on five shows per week through her online channel Etheridge TV. Set up via video-streaming platform Maestro in June, she says more than 1,000 subscribers have signed up to pay $50 a month for access.   ""I was looking at a year-and-a-half of no income so I decided to do my best with streaming,"" says the 59-year-old, who is based in Los Angeles. ""I had to learn everything about streaming, the internet, sound, lighting. Some days the internet gods are with us, some days nope, they boot us off. ""It's helped us heal and grow and stay connected, and pays the bills."" Although set up in 2015, it wasn't until Covid-19 that Maestro set its sights on the music industry. Founder Ari Evans says that as well as bringing in extra money, it can also generate extra information about fans for the artist and their record label.  ""With the data we hand to them, artists are able to know so many things, such as how did this audience interact during the live stream? What parts of the stream did they like the most? Once you know that you can start to optimise further events, and key measurements like watch time, retention and revenue. This is what artists need to know,"" says Evans. ""We like to think of it like a real-time focus group. No longer do they have to hand off this data to the likes of Facebook and Twitch in exchange for hearts and likes. They own the show."" Not to miss out on the Christmas season, some pantos are turning online this season.  Former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan is launching an online version of Jack and the Beanstalk after setting up a production crew to film the show in his back garden in London for four weeks. It will be streamed on a dedicated website, Panto Online, from 4 December. ""Though lockdown is the worst thing in the world it does make you proactive,"" says Duncan. ""Panto is about joy and fun and offering a positive approach amid all the doom and gloom. The beauty of online is we're not playing in one place and meaning more people can watch across the world."" Chris Rojek, professor of sociology at City University, London, and author of a book on the cult of celebrity, says over the last 50 years distance between celebrities and people has diminished considerably.  ""The Hollywood system used to be remoteness with the stars far above you and look up at them in awe. Social media means it's now really much more accessible."" But he's not a fan of the celebrity messages. ""What a waste of money,"" he says.",2020-11-17T00:05:18,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54870757,2020-11-17 10:00:49.359948,BBC,entertainment,0
Scotland celebrates Euro finals qualification,"Scotland has been celebrating the men's national football team's achievement in qualifying for its first major tournament in more than 20 years. The nail-biting penalty shoot out victory over Serbia secured qualification for the delayed Euro 2020 event, which will take place next year. The men's team last played in a major tournament back in 1998. There has been an outpouring of emotion from fans and players following the historic achievement. A tweet from Scotland manager Steve Clarke's son John was among those which summed up the national mood. He said: ""My dad is my hero. Watching my hero take Scotland to an international competition is the greatest thing I'll ever see."" My dad is my hero. Watching my hero take Scotland to an international competition is the greatest thing I'll ever see. Social media feeds were quickly filled with the moments which will live on in fans' memories. They ranged from goalkeeper David Marshall's delayed celebration to Ryan Christie's emotional post-match interview - and the team's joyful dressing room celebration to the song Yes Sir I Can Boogie. Comedian Kevin Bridges was one of those celebrating in the aftermath of the match, saying: ""Mad Scotland! Said it years ago that we'd quality for Euro 2021. Brilliant."" Outlander star Sam Heughan shared footage of the team celebrating in their hotel in Belgrade last night with the caption: ""They've already won Euros with this! Theyâve already won Euros with this! https://t.co/jT2Uf5Bvtn As the celebrations continued the morning after, veteran broadcaster Archie Macpherson described the emotions felt by many fans when the match went to penalties. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that he kept his eyes shut during the crucial shoot-out. ""I have a deep aversion to penalty shoot-outs that I think, eventually, only psychiatry will overcome,"" he said. He had commentated on the first ever penalty shoot out in European football, between Celtic and Inter Milan in Glasgow 1972 - when the first kick was missed by the home team. Mr Macpherson said: ""As the Scottish players walked up to the penalty spot I was actually seeing the ghost of Dixie Deans stepping forward and I expected to see the ball going over the bar or something like that.  ""It was very, very tense and I enjoyed it like a 10-year-old schoolboy."" However, Tartan Army member Scott Husband was keen to highlight the country's perfect penalty shoot-out record. The men's team has only taken part in two - and has won them both. He said: ""I actually was very cool. I thought we were going to win it.  ""We are the world champions at penalties. We have got a 100% record. We have taken 10 and scored 10."" Katie Howard will be one of the volunteers at next summer's tournament, when some of the matches will be played in Glasgow. She watched the decisive moment in her university student accommodation. ""The place blew up. It was so good,"" she said. And Scotland women's record goal scorer Julie Fleeting was still on cloud nine when she spoke to Good Morning Scotland. She said: ""I can't be the only Scot who struggled to get to sleep last night with all the excitement. ""It was just incredible. It was a tremendous way to do it. Very, very nerve-wracking but it just added to the excitement of it all.""  Massive congratulations to Steve Clarke and the team. After 22 years, @ScotlandNT men are off to a major tournament. What a lift for the country. Well done! ðð´ó §ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ Politicians at Holyrood and Westminster also praised the national team after the dramatic win.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Steve Clarke's history-makers. He posted: ""So great to see Scotland going forward to the Euros. Massive well done to the whole team."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross tweeted: ""Outstanding. We're going to the Euros."" Scottish Labour's Richard Leonard posted: ""Scotland has done it! Congratulations to the Scotland men's team on this historic night. The people of Scotland will be with them all the way as they march on to the Euros."" And Alison Johnstone, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, tweeted: ""YAAAAAS! Peak Scotland, that win!

Coronavirus doctor's diary: The Yorkshire cemetery struggling to keep up with burials,"Bradford's main Muslim cemetery has been struggling to keep up with burials as the second wave of the pandemic has gathered pace. It will take some medical detective work to determine the cause of this increase in deaths, says Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary, but multi-generational homes could be a factor. My friend Zulfi Karim called me on Friday with news about a sharp surge in deaths within Bradford's Muslim community. ""We've got three shifts of gravediggers and bereavement support people working from six in the morning until 10pm, preparing graves. In the last 10 days we've had 38 burials, which would be the figure we'd normally have in a bad winter month,"" he said. ""As fast as we're digging the graves we're filling them up with dead bodies. It's really really concerning, and my staff are getting to the stage where we're at full capacity. We're having to bring in a construction company to see if we can find new methods to design and prepare for digging a grave."" By Saturday the figure had risen to 44. Zulfi is the chairman of Bradford's Council of Mosques and the head of the Muslim Bereavement Service. He's attended every funeral, while also coping with long Covid himself. ""From a personal point of view I've never seen anything like it,"" he told me. ""I never thought I'd experience this here in the UK in a non-war situation."" In the Muslim tradition, a person should be buried within 24 hours of death, but Zulfi says it hasn't always been possible to keep up. It's going to take some work to fully understand what is going on. According to the Office for National Statistics, Bradford is currently seeing about 100 deaths per week (from all causes), up from 60 or 70 in the summer, but this isn't especially surprising; we expect this number to increase with the onset of winter. In the hospital, Covid-19 admission rates have surpassed the first peak in April, but the good news is that mortality remains considerably lower - less than a quarter of the rate in spring - as we have become experts in caring for and treating Covid patients. The average length of stay at Bradford Royal Infirmary has more than halved - from 13 days to six. Zulfi's hunch is that cases of Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed and that more people are dying from it at home than the statistics show. Back in February when the pandemic was hurtling towards us from the other side of the world, we watched how it devastated Italy and Spain and predicted that Bradford would also be badly hit. The city has a high population density and overcrowded housing, but also shares with Italy and Spain a pattern of multi-generational family homes.  One of the notable features in modelling population spread of infectious diseases is that the young have many more daily contacts than the old. The return to school and university in September will have increased these contacts and the resulting viral transmission, but the importance of maintaining education far outweighed the clinical risk from the virus. In cities like Bradford where school children and students (who often also live at home) were mixing with grandparents, this risk equation was always going to be different than in cities with fewer multi-generational homes. We now have a much clearer understanding about the variables that increase the risk of death from Covid - including ethnicity, gender and co-morbidities - but age is by far the greatest factor. And when grandparents share a house with young people, this heightens the risk. Over the last couple of weeks I have been hearing of more and more personal tragedies that illustrate this problem. Gulsoom Akhtar says her father, Akhtar Zaman, appeared at first to have an ordinary cold, but was later diagnosed with Covid-19 and taken to hospital on his GP's advice, with suspected pneumonia. He was soon placed in intensive care, and died five days later, on 3 November. He was buried the following day. ""It's absolutely awful how many people are dying. My dad was only 63. He'd had an angina attack several years ago but he was well and he had nine beautiful kids. I was just so overwhelmed and shocked,"" says Gulsoom, a neighbourhood engagement worker, part of whose job is to spread information about Covid-19. ""Our youngest brother is only 17. We are all devastated and my mum has lost her best friend after 35 years of marriage."" Amjad Pervez and his wife did their best to isolate on the third floor of their house, but continued to have some contact with their daughter, a university student, and with their school-age grandchildren. Amjad became ill with Covid in mid-October. ""In the second wave the children are getting Covid and not showing symptoms and particularly in the Asian community, where you have three generations living together, it doesn't work in our favour,"" he says. Amjad's mother, Hazran, was living with one of his brothers, in another multi-generational household. Later she moved to stay in the home of a third brother, where no-one was ill, and she could be better isolated. Nonetheless, the woman whom Amjad describes as ""fiercely independent"" and ""a fountain of wisdom"" began to show symptoms of Covid and was taken to hospital on Monday. She died on Tuesday evening and was buried the following day. ""I think people know now about the number of deaths, and people are scared witless, and they're being really careful about social distancing. People are petrified,"" says Amjad, owner of the Seafresh/Adams food retailing and cash-and-carry group.  ""I've lived in Bradford since 1969, I've grown up here, my business is here and my social network is huge. I've never in my life seen our community under so much mental stress and so scared."" Shadim Hussain, the father of four girls, had also taken measures to protect his parents, but somehow his mother became infected and was taken into hospital on Thursday. With pre-existing health problems, including chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, she deteriorated quickly, and Shadim was called to the hospital that evening. ""I could see it looked really difficult for Mum and instinctively we're taught as Muslims to say a prayer - there's a special prayer that I said with Mum and she repeated it after me. I could see her lips were still moving and I sensed she knew I was there,"" says Shadim, the founder of a fostering recruitment and training organisation, My Foster Family. She died that night and was buried on Friday. ""In the morning we picked up the body and we did the bathing of the body. By midday we got the body prepared for burial and our slot at the cemetery was at 7pm that night,"" says Shadim. ""It was in the dark and there was something special about it - it felt quite peaceful. I got a call from Zulfi and he said, 'Whatever you need just let me know.' It was like having an army of people around, who wanted to help us."" As we observed the two-minute silence on Remembrance Day the UK was becoming the first country in Europe to surpass 50,000 deaths from Covid-19. There will be no Last Post bugle call for these fallen souls. The vaccines against coronavirus cannot come soon enough. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa.

"Soumitra Chatterjee: India acting legend dies, aged 85","Legendary Indian actor Soumitra Chatterjee, famed for his work with Oscar-winning director Satyajit Ray, has died from Covid complications. The 85-year-old actor was admitted to hospital in Kolkata city on 6 October after he tested positive for the virus. He will be mourned by fans and critics who avidly followed his six-decade-long career in Bengali language films.  Chatterjee, who starred in more than 300 movies, was also an accomplished playwright, theatre actor and poet.  He tested negative a few weeks after he was admitted to hospital but his condition soon deteriorated and he was put on a ventilator in the last week of October. He died on Sunday morning. Chatterjee was perhaps best-known for his work with Ray, one of the world's most influential directors and maker of the much-feted Apu Trilogy. The series followed the life of a man who grew up in a Bengali village. The films garnered critical acclaim, winning many awards worldwide, and put Indian cinema on the global map.  The third movie of the trilogy, Apur Sansar, which released in 1959, was also Chatterjee's debut film. He would go on to star as the lead actor in 14 of Ray's films. Pauline Kael, one of America's most influential and respected film critics, called Chatterjee Ray's ""one-man stock company"" who moved ""so differently in the different roles he plays that he is almost unrecognisable"". Chatterjee was awarded the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, the highest honour in Indian cinema, in 2012 and in 2018, he was given France's highest award, the Legion of Honour.  He began acting when he was in school, where he starred in several plays. He was in college when a friend introduced him to Ray - it was a chance meeting, but it eventually led to Chatterjee's film debut.  ""I didn't know what to do when Mr Ray first asked me. I didn't know what was the real difference between stage and screen acting. I was afraid I'd overact,"" he told Marie Seton, film critic and biographer, in an interview. Chatterjee's roles in more than a dozen films made by the auteur spanned a wide range.  He played a Sherlock Holmes-like detective in Sonar Kella, an effete bridegroom in Devi, a hot-tempered north Indian taxi driver in Abhijan, a city slicker in Aranyer Din Ratri, and a mild-mannered village priest in Ashani Sanket. He also played what Seton called a ""thinly veiled portrait"" of Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Charulata, one of Ray's most admired films. ""His chief asset was the natural sensitivity of his appearance,"" Seton wrote of the actor. Ray mentored his favourite actor, lending him books on cinema and often taking him to watch Sunday morning shows of Hollywood films in Kolkata. ""The entire exercise he did with a purpose, it was not as if he was taking me out on Sundays for entertainment,"" Chatterjee once said. Ray, who died in 1992, had said that Chatterjee was an intelligent actor and ""given bad material, he turns out a bad performance"".  ""Not a day passed when I do not think of Ray or discuss him or miss him. He is a constant presence in my life, if not for anything else but for the inspiration I derive when I think about him,"" Chatterjee told an interviewer. Chatterjee also played the romantic lead in popular Bengali films, but his appeal, say critics, was more limited than the reigning star, Uttam Kumar. Over the years, Chatterjee worked with leading directors like Tapan Sinha, Mrinal Sen, Asit Sen, Ajoy Kar, Rituparno Ghosh and Aparna Sen. In 1988, he worked with John Hurt and Hugh Grant in The Bengali Night, a film set in Kolkata. Adoor Gopalakrishnan, one of India's greatest filmmakers, said that on screen, Chatterjee ""became the quintessential Bengali - intellectually inclined, of middle-class orientation, sensitive and likeable"". Outside films, Chatterjee was tirelessly creative: he edited a literary magazine, published more than 30 books of essays and poetry; acted, directed and wrote an equal number of plays; and painted.  One of his most successful plays, Ghatak Bidey, a comedy, ran for 500 nights. Chatterjee acted in a commercially successful Bengali adaption of King Lear, which many believe was one of his finest performances on stage.  For all his popularity, Chatterjee stayed away from Bollywood, preferring to act in Bengali language films. ""Soumitra is the finest actor in the land today, but totally unheard of outside Bengal. It's a loss for India, Bollywood and I guess, a bit for Soumitra,"" Pritish Nandy, poet, journalist and filmmaker, said of the actor in 2012. Amitava Nag, author of a biography of the actor, says Chatterjee was ""the thinking man's hero. He was an intellectual and a poet"". Nag once asked Chatterjee whether he felt burdened by the obligation to entertain. ""Very seldom. This is my job,"" he said.",2020-11-15T07:21:20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-54500364,2020-11-15 16:15:02.023053,BBC,entertainment,0
Covid: Leicester's lockdown Diwali 'is like our Christmas gone',"By Sandish ShokerBBC News Online Every year, Leicester's Golden Mile - the city's length of road famous for its South Asian connections - becomes a noisy, joyous mass of colour and light as residents and visitors from around the world celebrate Diwali. But this year's lockdown means festivities will look very different. For years the city has played host to one of the biggest celebrations of the festival of light outside India, with Hindus, Sikhs and Jains catching up, dressing in their finest clothes, cooking feasts and exchanging gifts. For two nights of the year the road attracts 40-50,000 people for the lights switch-on and an evening of music and dancing. Joshna Ramji, 62, who lives in nearby Oadby, said she loved the ""buzz of the Golden Mile"" during Diwaili but this year felt very strange. ""Normally all the shops have decorations and signs up in their windows,"" she said. ""[The Golden Mile] is full of people buying gifts, food, new clothes or getting their hair done. ""But this year nobody is doing that and it is very, very quiet as businesses are closed. The atmosphere is very different."" Leicester is the only British city to have been living under coronavirus restrictions continuously since March, meaning even though its usual celebrations have been severely curtailed, the urge to enjoy the festivities has for many people in the city been stronger than ever. ""Diwali is all about light over darkness and good over evil, which is even more important this year,"" said Mrs Ramji. ""It will bring a lot of pleasure to everybody at a time some people are feeling isolated and alone."" Instead of the usual week-long of celebrations with friends and family, Mrs Ramji will just be cooking for herself and her husband at home. ""Normally we wake up early for prayers, light up candles and then have a lavish, lavish Indian meal at my sister's house and have fireworks,"" she said. ""This year it will just be us, but I'm going to put candles at the front of the house, inside, the back of the house and in the garden, just to make it feel as special as possible. ""It is a bit sad but we have to try and keep the Diwali spirit however we can otherwise it would be miserable."" Owners of businesses on the Golden Mile who had hoped to rely on Diwali to make up for their losses this year described the road as ""very eerie"". Dharmesh Lakhani, who owns Bobby's restaurant, said: ""The lights are up, the decorations are up but there are only a few people shopping for food and groceries. ""This festival is like our Christmas. So this is our Christmas gone."" Mr Lakhani said takings around the festival would be 15% of the usual trade. ""Businesses all down the road would be gearing up for this period with their new clothing designs and making all the sweets and we would have bookings of families meeting up for dinner,"" he said. ""Usually our shop is really busy, the road is busy and it's something celebrated by not just Hindus and Sikhs, but the whole city."" Karan Modha, who owns clothes shop Anokhi Sarees, said people would usually be buying new clothes for their Diwali celebrations or to give as gifts.  ""People who are furloughed or lost their jobs are not going to be thinking about buying new outfits this year,"" he said. ""If they are doing a Zoom, they will just put some make up on, do their hair and wear something old."" This year will be the first time the shop has not hosted an in-store party for the celebration since the 1970s. ""It's going to be sad sitting at home instead, not knowing what to do with myself,"" added Mr Modha.  ""The whole street feels weird at the moment. It doesn't feel like Diwali. There's not that jolly, vibrant feel.  ""We are known for our window display at Diwali and we did it anyway because we wanted to still keep that tradition.  ""This year I included a statue of Ganesh to spread some luck and joy, not just for ourselves and the other businesses on the street, but for everybody. ""We all need some kind of luck this year."" Praful Bhatt, who runs meals on wheels charity Jalaram Sadvrat Leicester, has been delivering Diwali goody bags to elderly people to lift their spirits. ""This time has been pretty bad for the elderly and the vulnerable,"" he said. ""We've put together some bags with special Diwali foods - ghughra, chakli, mathia and Indian sweets barfi and halwa."" Mr Bhatt, who has been delivering food to elderly people since March, said it would be a very different festival. ""This time it'll be staying home as opposed to going out to celebrate but people are still upbeat about it,"" he said. Despite the lockdown restrictions, the city council said it wanted people to enjoy Diwali from their own homes with a virtual celebration. Councillor Piara Singh Clair said a video including messages from community leaders, as well as religious, musical and cultural elements, would be available on the Visit Leicester website from 19:00 GMT on Saturday. He said his ""heart went out"" to businesses on the Golden Mile. ""It was a big day they were looking forward to,"" he said. Mr Singh Clair said he was disappointed so many key celebrations for the city had been disrupted this year but hoped one positive of the virtual Diwali event was that it would be shared with families worldwide.  Indeed, there have been hopes the quieter tone of this year's celebrations could bring other aspects of Diwali to the fore. Nima Suchak, a volunteer at the Hare Krishna Temple in Granby Street, has been taking part in virtual meditation and prayers every evening this month, which she said had been ""comforting"" during lockdown. ""In one sense it takes away all the external stuff of Diwali that people do get caught up in - the food, the gifts,"" said the 43-year-old from Knighton. ""Diwali is the pinnacle of the year for us, of bringing light into our lives, and there are opportunities that have come with lockdown that have meant personal reflection. ""Covid has impacted us all, so in one sense we might not be celebrating in a big way but we can take this time to look after ourselves and each other. ""We are going to be thinking about those less fortunate and see Diwali, just like Christmas, as a time that's not just about eating and drinking, but about thinking of others.""

Covid: What's happening with next year's exams?,"With Covid-19 cases rising, the UK nations are already delaying or cancelling next year's school exams, and adopting a range of measures to keep pupils safe. The Welsh government has cancelled next summer's GCSE, AS and A-level exams.  Grades will be based on classroom assessments, done under teacher supervision, and will begin in the second half of the spring term in 2021.  Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney has said that National 5 exams, roughly equivalent to GCSEs in England, will not go ahead in 2021. They will be replaced by teacher assessments and coursework. Higher and Advanced Higher exams will go ahead as usual, but ""slightly later"" in the year. He confirmed there is a contingency plan should they also need to be called off. In England, next summer's A-levels and GCSEs are still due to go ahead - but with reduced content for some subjects and a start date pushed back by three weeks. Most exams will now start from 7 June, rather than mid-May. In Northern Ireland, A-level, AS and GCSE exams will start one week later in 2021, but will still finish by 30 June. Measures being taken include hand sanitiser stations, one-way systems and staggered break times. Enhanced cleaning procedures have been introduced, and social distancing wherever possible. In England, younger children are being encouraged to mix in small groups or ""bubbles"" to balance out the fact they are unlikely to stay 2m apart. In Wales and Scotland, pupils are exempt from the 2m distancing rule ""because it is harder for children to understand the concept of physical distancing"". Older children, such as those in secondary schools, are being encouraged to avoid touching one another as much as possible. Walking or cycling is encouraged. Parents should not gather in groups at school gates, or go on site without an appointment.  Many schools have asked parents to wear face coverings at drop off and pick up.  Dedicated school transport services have been asked to: Pupils and teachers in all of England's secondary schools and colleges are now required to wear face masks in communal areas and corridors. Previously they were only mandatory in parts of England that were under local restrictions. The Scottish government says all secondary school pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas, and senior pupils (years S4-S6) and their teachers must wear them in class in the new level 3 and 4 restriction areas. Other guidance advises staff to wear face coverings in all schools, where social distancing is not possible. In Wales, face coverings are recommended in high schools when social distancing is ""unlikely to be maintained"", but they are not compulsory. In Northern Ireland, face coverings must be worn in the corridors of post-primary schools, and on school and public transport. If someone tests positive, they must be sent home to self-isolate for 14 days.  The school must then contact their local public health protection team, who will advise on who else should be sent home. Anyone who has been in close contact with the person testing positive, will be advised to self-isolate for 14 days from their last date of contact. Close contact means:  Before term began, the government said closing an entire school would not generally be necessary.  According to the most recent figures, 55% of secondary schools and 20% of primaries in England reported having one or more pupils self-isolating because of potential contact with a case of coronavirus in the school. This is up from 46% and 16% respectively on the previous week. If pupils can't come in, schools must have a home-working plan available. The NHS says the main Covid-19 symptoms are:  If a child shows these symptoms, they - and other members of their household - should self-isolate for 14 days and get tested if possible. A runny nose is more likely to be a symptom of a cold, and is not a reason to get tested for coronavirus, says NHS Scotland. All schools in England have been provided with a small number of testing kits, to be offered to a pupil or staff member in the ""exceptional circumstance"" they cannot get tested any other way.  The government says the test kits should be given to an adult or else a child's parent or carer, who should carry out the test off-site (unless it is a boarding school).  Testing kits have also been provided to schools and colleges in Wales and Northern Ireland, but Scotland has not followed suit.",2020-11-12T10:33:30,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,2020-11-13 14:43:04.626998,BBC,politics,0
Lockdown loneliness soared after clocks went back,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News The week after the clocks went back saw Britain's highest levels of loneliness since the pandemic began, according to Office for National Statistics figures. The start of November, with darker evenings, had 4.2 million adults always or often lonely, compared with 2.6 million before the pandemic. This was the peak in levels of acute loneliness since the lockdown in March. Loneliness Minister Baroness Barran says the next few months will be ""incredibly challenging"". Figures also show that about 2.6 million adults had not left their home for any reason in the previous seven days. Psychologist Vivian Hill says the ""descent into winter"" can be a ""very significant factor"" in how people feel about loneliness, with less daylight and colder weather reducing the opportunity to get outside. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) research, based on surveys of more than 4,000 people, found the young were particularly likely to feel cut off - with 16 to 29-year-olds twice as likely as the over-70s to be experiencing loneliness in the pandemic. Elorm Fiavor from Salford, a young carer looking after her mother who is shielding, said there needed to more recognition of the pressures of loneliness on young people. ""It needs to be OK to talk about it,"" says the 16-year-old, who misses being able to go out with friends and socialising and who is helping a charity, Lonely Not Alone, which tackles isolation among the young.  ""There's a lot of stigma attached to it. ""There's a great misconception that when people think of loneliness they only think of older people who are living alone."" Student Jade Low says he has missed partying and socialising in the pandemic - but the challenge is to ""punch through"" and find ways to keep in touch and stay motivated. ""Everyone feels lonely sometimes,"" says the student at Imperial College London - and to keep himself busy he has taught himself to play the ukulele. The figures from the ONS show about one in four people experiencing some form of loneliness at the start of November. But that week, following the clocks going back an hour and evenings getting darker earlier, saw a particular spike in the most acute levels of loneliness - those ""always or often"" lonely. There were 8% of adults in this category - higher than at any point since March and above the 5% typically reported pre-pandemic and during parts of the summer, as restrictions were relaxed. The numbers on loneliness have fluctuated through the pandemic, and nudged down again after the peak in the week ending 1 November - but they have consistently shown between 10 and 14 million people feeling some form of loneliness. Dr Vivian Hill, who is the British Psychological Society's lead on isolation in the pandemic, says loneliness is a serious problem - and could be made more difficult in winter. But she says it is something that can be tackled and people should be optimistic about being able to make connections and reduce loneliness. Baroness Barran says there are new groups facing loneliness in the pandemic - such as those without internet access and those working from home who would usually rely on workplaces for their social lives. The loneliness minister said there was funding for grassroots community projects to help people stay in touch. But she said it was important not to underestimate the impact of things individuals could do - such as ringing someone up, writing a letter or helping a neighbour. ""It's those simple things that make people feel valued,"" she said.",2020-11-18T01:15:13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54973709,2020-11-18 08:28:22.149812,BBC,financial,0
Ethiopia Tigray crisis: Government says airports damaged in rocket fire,"The Ethiopian government says local forces in the northern state of Tigray have fired rockets into a neighbouring region. Tension between the government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, boiled over into military clashes this month. The rocket attack on Friday damaged ""airport areas"", the government said. TPLF has not confirmed it, but has said ""any airport used to attack Tigray"" is a ""legitimate target"", AFP reports. In a tweet, the Ethiopian government's emergency task-force said the rockets were fired towards the cities of Bahir Dar and Gondar, in Amhara state, late on Friday. ""The TPLF junta is utilising the last of the weaponry within its arsenals,"" it wrote, adding that an investigation had been launched.  An official told Reuters news agency that one rocket hit the airport in Gondar and partially damaged it, while a second one fired simultaneously landed just outside of the airport in Bahir Dar. Both airports are used by military and civilian aircraft. The rocket attack has raised fears that fighting in Ethiopia's northernmost state could spread to other parts of the country.  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military operation against the TPLF earlier this month after he accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops - claims the TPLF deny. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in the region. The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. Reports of the rocket attack came after Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate reports of mass killings in Tigray. Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera), a town in the South West Zone of Tigray, on 9 November.  It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from. Mr Abiy has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre, saying they went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray. Some witnesses also said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"". In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind the killings. The UN human rights chief warned the killings could amount to war crimes. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.  Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp. By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.  There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed. In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders. On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region. I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.  I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.

Wrexham Roman villa uncovered by metal detectorists,"A Roman villa has been found near Wrexham - the first of its kind in north east Wales. Metal detectorists found Roman material at the site, sparking a remote sensing survey by archaeologists who have found evidence of a buried structure. The remains, in a field in Rossett, include stone and tile buildings around a central courtyard. An archaeology lecturer involved said it may change understanding of the area in Roman Britain. Artefacts have been found from the late 1st Century and early 4th Century, suggesting the villa was occupied for the majority of Roman rule in Britain. Dr Caroline Pudney, Senior Lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Chester which was involved in the survey, said: ""This exciting discovery potentially alters our understanding of north east Wales in the wake of the Roman conquest. ""Previous interpretations suggest that most people in this area either lived in settlements associated with Roman military sites or in quite simple farmsteads that continued to utilise Iron Age roundhouse architectural forms. ""The identification of the villa now questions this narrative."" The university and Wrexham museum now plan to continue investigating the site over the next few years.",2020-11-12T14:20:08,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54919775,2020-11-15 16:21:46.388807,BBC,world,0

I'm A Celebrity: How Hollie Arnold got her MBE,"Winter is officially here. How do we know? Not the grim weather, the dark nights or mince pies in shops. No - I'm A Celeb's back on telly. This year's contestants include TV presenter Vernon Kay, actor Shane Richie and BBC Radio 1's own Jordan North.  But it was the way one contestant introduced herself that got fans talking - step forward ""Hollie Arnold, MBE"". And cue an ""ooh"" from Victoria Derbyshire. Here's what you need to know about Hollie. She's 26 and competes in F46 javelin, having been born without her right forearm. ""Holly possesses an inner strengthâ¦ she's strong, she's powerful,"" says her friend and training partner Dan Greaves. Her first Paralympics was in Beijing in 2008, when she was just 14 years old.  She went on to compete in London in 2012, and Rio in 2016 - and that's where she won gold, setting a new world record at the same time. There's more: In 2018. Hollie won gold in the Commonwealth Games and European Championships (where she beat her own world record).  ""Not many athletes can really turn it turn it on for the big events, but Holly can,"" says her friend Dan. He would know all about that - he's won gold medals in the Paralympics, Commonwealth Games, World Championships and European Championships himself in the F44/46 in the discus throw. Oh yeah, we're not done with Hollie's achievements yet. She's also won every World Championship since 2013. ""She's got what's called the full house in athletics,"" says Dan.  ""She's got Paralympic, World, European and Commonwealth champion. So there literally is nothing else that she can win."" Ooh indeed. We should also point out that another British athlete introduced himself to the audience as ""Sir Mo Farah"" on last night's show.  Shane Ritchie declined to mention that when he introduced Sir Mo to the other contestants down a walkie talkie. We're pretty sure you can get locked up in the Tower of London for that.  Although that might be more comfortable than his current accommodation in Gwyrch Castle. Anyway, Hollie did mention the MBE down the walkie, and it's something she's ""especially proud of,"" according to Dan.  He does realise how it might have come across, though. ""Bless her. I know how she would have meant to say that. She loves it,"" he adds. And he admits he's just a little bit jealous of the honour, which Hollie got in 2017 for services to field athletics. ""She's done exceptionally well in her sport so hats off to her for being recognised for it,"" he says. Dan's looking forward to seeing Hollie in the rest of the series. ""What people don't see behind the scenes is how she adapts and how she gains strength from her disability,"" he says. ""Holly's got great personality... she'll make some great friends and I think she'll get stuck into the challenges as well."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Covid: Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News Workers for firms hit by lockdowns or Covid restrictions can now be furloughed until the end of March. Under the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, employees placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month.  The scheme pays some of the wages of people who can't do their jobs because their workplace is closed, or there is no longer enough work for them. They may also be unable to work because someone in their household has to shield, or they have caring responsibilities due to coronavirus, such as looking after children. You can be furloughed whether you are on a full-time, part-time, agency, flexible or zero-hour contract.  You must have been on the payroll by 30 October 2020. It is not necessary to have been furloughed before and you keep all your working rights, including annual and parental leave. There is also some help for people who recently lost their jobs but were not placed on furlough. If you were employed and on the payroll on 23 September, but were then made redundant or stopped working, you can be re-employed and claimed for by your former employer. While you are on furlough you can take on other jobs, as long as it doesn't break the rules of your contract. You can also take part in training, or volunteer for an unconnected organisation. Since July, employers have been able to bring back employees part-time, and furlough them for the rest. This will continue, and employers will have to pay employee's wages for the hours they work as normal. Furlough was due to be replaced by the Job Support Scheme on 1 November. But as month-long restrictions began in England, including the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops, the government said furlough would continue. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says it will run until the end of March, although the government will decide in January whether employers should start paying into the scheme. While employees won't notice any difference in their pay packet, the scheme has become more generous for employers, who will pay less towards it.  In recent months, firms have had to top up furloughed wages by 20%, with the government paying 60%. Now, the state will put in the full 80%, with the employer only covering pension and National Insurance contributions. While the government updates the system, employers will submit their wage claim to the government, and be refunded afterwards. After that, they will be paid upfront to cover the cost.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed the scheme will still apply throughout the UK, saying the country had ""a Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom"". About 10 million jobs have already been claimed for, with an estimated two million people still on furlough at the end of October.

Transgender struggle: 'I had to keep who I was secret',"By Ivana DavidovicBusiness reporter, BBC News ""I had to live two lives. I had to keep who I was secret,"" says Caroline Paige, recalling her life over 20 years ago, when she was a Royal Air Force pilot - and a man.  During her 35-year air force career, she flew F4 Phantom fighters intercepting Soviet bombers during the Cold War. She served in the Gulf War and then switched from jets to helicopters - in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.  It was a macho environment and very ""Top Gun"" but Caroline loved her job - despite needing to hide her true identity due to a law barring LGBTQ+ people in the UK's armed forces. ""The consequences of being outed were quite horrendous,"" she says. But when she hit her thirties, she was tired of pretence.  One option was to leave and transition outside the military. But Caroline decided to fight her case.   Despite the law being against her, she presented her medical assessments to her unit's medical officer. Caroline says she was petrified but the officer, also a woman, was ""absolutely wonderful and became an ally"" who took up her case. This was Caroline's first step in taking on the military establishment and becoming the first transgender officer to serve openly in the Britain's armed forces. ""As soon as my presence was known within the military, I got a lot of hostile reaction with people calling for my resignation,"" she recalls. ""I was outed in the media. People were demanding why a trans person should be allowed to serve. I would walk into a room and people would turn their backs to me. They would ask what I was doing in 'their' air force - sniggering, giggling, pointing, laughing and mocking."" Over the cacophony of threats and insults, the voices of allies grew louder but Caroline says she still felt very vulnerable: ""I had to prove my value to the military.""  ""I set out to be the best possible person in my role. We went out to Iraq and Afghanistan, where my job of tactics and platform protection was key, and I ended up winning lots of awards. People started realising it's not about who you are, it's about what you can do.""   Meanwhile, in 2000, the UK ban on gay and bisexual people in the military was lifted and extended to transgender members in 2014. But globally the struggle of transgender people to gain rights has ignited an explosive debate. South African author Mark Gevisser sees the so-called ""Pink Line"" - explained in his new book of the same name - as the frontline of the new gender and culture wars.  In terms of protection from workplace discrimination, he says the best countries are those which allow people to legally change their gender on official documents through self-determination alone, rather than any sort of ""certification"".  ""If you arrive at a job interview presenting as a woman but your ID says that you are a man, you are immediately vulnerable to discrimination because how is the company going to process you?"" There are currently about 12 countries that allow people to legally change their gender through self-determination. Almost all of them are in western Europe or Latin America.  The issue has become contentious in some countries, says Mr Gevisser. The UK was initially considering self-determination but has since decided against this. In India, where a Supreme Court ruling allows self-determination, the government itself is now saying that some form of certification is required.  India is also one of very few countries that has mandated affirmative action in the workplace for transgender people but the stigma attached to them is preventing widespread recognition. ""Everywhere in the world there is a dance between legal recognition and social change,"" says Mr Gevisser. Generations coming of age are increasingly questioning their identities and reasons for conforming to certain expectations of what being a man or a woman means - so conversations about gender and identity are only going to gather pace. Sometimes the shifting sands of politics will reverse equality legislation, as happened in Hungary earlier this year. Leaders like Viktor Orban in Hungary or Vladimir Putin in Russia see these ""'European' norms in contradiction with their national traditional values,"" says Mr Gevisser. Some countries in Asia have historically had a third gender in their cultures, giving trans people some  limited rights - but campaigners are now fighting for greater recognition. Kath Khangpiboon is a sociology lecturer at Bangkok's Thammasat University. But because Thailand does not legally allow gender changes she is still referred to as ""mister"" at work even though she lives as a woman. And she has had to fight for her job. She accepted the post in 2014 but was barred from taking it up for nine months, meaning the job offer was withdrawn. She accused the university of discrimination and successfully took it to court - finally taking up her role in 2018. Although Thailand passed its first gender equality law in 2015, the reality is often very different. Bangkok may often be the only Asian city included on lists of gay-friendly tourist destinations and is well known for its gender reassignment operations - but Kath, who now feels accepted by her work colleagues, says this image is a ""big myth"" for transgender Thais - especially at work. ""Transgender people work in the entertainment and beauty industries as dancers and makeup artists. Society allows them to do that,"" she says. ""But for lawyers, lecturers and teachers that is different, because transgender people are not allowed in a professional society."" So what does an inclusive workplace for transgender people look like? ""One where a trans person can show up as authentically as they like,"" says Lily Zheng, a California-based diversity consultant, who is herself transgender. ""I want to be respected. I want to be comfortable coming to work and either being very out with my trans identity or not having it mentioned at all,"" she says.  Lily believes the onus is on leaders, rather than transgender workers, to make it non-negotiable that people are referred to with the pronouns they introduce themselves with. But also to offer support and advice for any employees who are uncomfortable and want to learn more.   ""Frankly, I would approach it in the same way if someone told me they didn't agree with black people being in the workplace or women working in the same workplace as men,"" she says. ""Companies do have to take a side.""",2020-11-17T00:08:03,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54965038,2020-11-17 09:59:48.207204,BBC,politics,0
Essex lorry deaths accused left UK over 'very big investigation',"A man accused over the deaths of 39 migrants who were found in a lorry trailer told jurors he fled the UK later that day because he was ""scared"". Gheorge Nica, 43, denies any role in the deaths of the Vietnamese nationals, who were found in Grays, Essex, on 23 October 2019, the Old Bailey has heard. He admits some people-smuggling crimes, but said he had been unaware any migrants were in the trailer in Grays. ""I knew it's going to be a very, very big investigation,"" he said. Mr Nica, who is British-Romanian, added: ""I just go home to see my family and kids again."" He flew from Luton to Romania on the evening of 23 October and was arrested four months later in Germany. The migrants, aged 15 to 44, suffocated in a sealed trailer en route from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet, Essex. Mr Nica, of Basildon, and lorry driver Eamonn Harrison, 23, of County Down, deny 39 counts of manslaughter. Mr Nica told the jury that he thought the shipment was an ""expensive load"" of tobacco or alcohol. At about 01:00 on 23 October, people waiting to collect the load began asking him what was going on, he said. He called lorry driver Maurice Robinson and he seemed to be in a panic - ""his breath was like he was running"", Mr Nica told the jury. ""I felt like there was something not right with him."" He said Mr Robinson did not mention the deaths and then at 01:27, he called Mr Nica. ""He said 'I have a problem here',"" Mr Nica told the jury. ""'I have dead bodies on the trailer.' ""When he said that, I said 'listen, what do you mean dead bodies?'.  ""He said 'yeah there are too many'. He said 'I don't know what to do'. ""I said 'ring the ambulance and ring the police. Don't move'."" Mr Nica said he dropped off a hire car he had been using and asked his wife to book him a flight. Irish haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and Mr Robinson, 26, have previously admitted manslaughter. Mr Harrison, lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, have denied being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy, which Mr Nica has admitted he was involved in.

Fibre broadband: The cost of delivering in rural areas,"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter  Wisbech is a pretty market town in Cambridgeshire but it's an area divided by access to fast broadband. Paul Brett moved to the area in 2003, seeking a slightly more laid-back way of life. But as a software engineer, he also needed fast broadband. And despite being in a location that is not exactly rural  - he can see the town from his house - he has struggled, initially on a 0.5Mbps (megabits per second) connection when he moved in, rising to 5Mbps now - still in the bottom few in the country for broadband speed. A few years ago he was hopeful he could make the leap into the 21st century when a technology called Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) finally became available to the town. He was disappointed to find it didn't help. ""My speed halved - rather than being an upgrade it got worse, so I immediately cancelled that and got my money back,"" he says. That's because FTTC, as the name suggests, runs only to the nearest green street cabinet. For the last part of the journey, broadband has to travel along old copper wire â which means that the further away you live, the worse the speed gets. Not to be defeated, Mr Brett clubbed together with some of his neighbours to persuade BT to run 1Gbps (gigabit per second) fibre broadband to their street. But when the quote came back from Openreach, the spin-off from BT that is responsible for the vast majority of the UK's broadband infrastructure, he was shocked. ""I was quoted Â£101,855.00 - which seemed high."" There was no breakdown of the cost but Openreach had helpfully done some of the maths - for 17 premises the cost per home or business would be Â£5,991.47, with the possibility of vouchers taking an estimated Â£20,000 off the overall estimate. Mr Brett estimates that he is about 1.4 km (0.9 miles) away ""as the crow flies"" but a little longer if he takes into account the route BT would use to get fibre all the way to his home (known as fibre to the premises, or FTTP). Matthew Bateman, Openreach's director of infrastructure development, explained why it would be so expensive. ""We have to take a physical fibre cable along roads and fields and it needs to be put in underground ducts or across poles. The civil-engineering costs could involve road closures and the erection of several poles. These are all very large costs."" But with so many people choosing to live in rural locations and more and more working from home in response to the Covid-19 crisis, Mr Brett thinks it is time for BT to ""think outside the box"". ""BT needs to come up with innovative solutions which aren't just about how far you are from their exchange, which they built back in the 1970s,"" he said. ""With the electricity power grid, you have main stations and then substations. Maybe something along those lines is needed to deliver a broadband network suitable for people who want to live good lives in rural locations. ""I'd like them to think on a decade-to-decade basis. Ultimately, we we need a network that everyone can use. This pandemic has brought that into focus."" Openreach points out that the number of people in the UK still struggling on broadband speeds below 10Mbps is low - by its estimate, 600,000 premises across the UK. Mike Hooper lives in the heart of the English countryside, about 3km from Grizebeck, in Cumbria. He applied under USO to find out how much it would cost to bring fibre broadband to his street - and was quoted Â£152,821 for installation.  He said the quote, which was for six properties, made him laugh. ""It's ridiculous. There is no way we can afford that,"" he said. Unlike in the case of Mr Brett, his letter - from BT rather than Openreach - did at least break down the costs: BT signed off the letter with an apologetic note: ""We appreciate this is a lot of money."" ""From what I can tell they only have to drape some cables across a telegraph pole. I asked for a more detailed breakdown but they told me it would be anti-competitive,"" Mr Hooper told the BBC. Mr Hooper has tried other avenues. A rural community broadband group, B4RN, has provided fibre to lots of Cumbrian homes. But to make it cost-effective, it needed more than 1,000 occupiers to agree to installation. Rallying even a few neighbours can be a frustrating process, said Mr Brett. ""BT relies on people getting communities together but it is difficult to get a consensus."" ""I tried to get the whole street involved, and people were interested up to the point that they actually have to pay for it,"" he said. The government is planning to inject Â£5bn towards an ambitious goal of delivering 1Gb broadband to everyone by 2025.  ""We are waiting with bated breath and hope to see this scheme, which is subject to ministerial approval, in place by the end of the year,"" said Mr Bateman. Meanwhile, the message for Mr Brett and Mr Hooper remains unsatisfactory. ""Our desire is to get broadband to everyone but the costs are very real, and without government intervention, quotes will remain high,"" he said. For Mr Brett, it feels that there is something of postcode lottery about where fibre goes and what it costs. He claims that a friend of his,  who lives in a remote Welsh valley, received fibre broadband from BT, with speeds of 150Mbps, with no up-front costs. ""They can get it to a Welsh village in the middle of nowhere but they can't get it to Wisbech,"" he said. ""It's not good enough, really.""",2020-11-15T00:56:22,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54718673,2020-11-15 16:19:57.660289,BBC,technology,0
Wild Mountain Thyme: Is an Irish accent the hardest to master?,"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent The trailer for the film Wild Mountain Thyme, starring Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt, has prompted howls of derision for its Hollywood ""Oirish"" accents and clichÃ©d paddy whackery. The film, also starring Christopher Walken and Jon Hamm, is a romantic comedy set in rural Ireland. It almost inevitably has a subplot about the inheritance of a farm. Some critics say the actors rival Tom Cruise in Far And Away for worst Irish accent ever in a Hollywood film. Jamie Dornan, who is from County Down, has been described as a Northern Irish man impersonating an American impersonating a southern Irish farmer. Various commentators have been providing their take on the film's trailer. Thereâs fashion policeGrammar police We even have airport police Is there such a thing as accent police?If so, somebody better call âem. On the upside, Ireland looks nice. pic.twitter.com/lHrR5cWlwq The Dublin Airport Authority in a tweet says: ""There's fashion police, Grammar police, we even have airport police.   ""Is there such a thing as accent police? If so somebody better call 'em.  ""On the upside, Ireland looks nice."" The pretty visuals also featured in a tongue-in-cheek tweet from the Irish embassy in Washington. ""To be fair, Irish accents are hard (we struggle with them at times).  ""But otherwise Wild Mountain Thyme looks great.   ""And Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt  present a remarkably realistic depiction, visually at least, of the average Irish man and woman.

And, in Jamie Dornan & Emily Blunt, presents a remarkably realistic depiction, visually at least, of the average Irish man & woman. Truly, we are a beautiful people. https://t.co/B2HFOkAhJ0 The trailer also provided comedian Dara Ã Briain with food for thought. ""For the record, I could only manage half of the Wild Mountain Thyme trailer.  ""I have put the rest of it back in the fridge for later, where it will stay untouched until I eventually throw it out in a month."" For the record, I could only manage half of the Wild Mountain Thyme trailer. I have put the rest of it back in the fridge for later, where it will stay untouched until I eventually throw it out in a month. And the The National Leprechaun Museum of Ireland tweeted: ""Even we think this is a bit much #WildMountainThyme"". The film is based on the play Outside Mullingar, by the Irish-American playwright John Patrick Shanley, and was filmed largely in County Mayo. Although Wild Mountain Thyme is not yet on general release, that has not stopped people commenting based on the trailer. Some have suggested it is the price people must pay for Irish-American Joe Biden's presidency, others that it is an offence to begorrah culture and the twin Irish gods of Guinness and potatoes. Wild Mountain Thyme is due for release in the United States on 11 December, but in the meantime it has attracted a lot of publicity. If, however, all publicity is good publicity it might yet result in many more than expected checking the film out to see if it's as bad as the accents suggest it might be.",2020-11-11T13:18:15,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/54904034,2020-11-14 11:15:38.648800,BBC,entertainment,0
"India tiger awaits mate after 'longest' 3,000 km journey","He has completed the longest walk by a tiger ever recorded in India and ""settled"" in a sanctuary, where he is the only big cat. Fondly called Walker by wildlife officials, the now three-and-a-half-year-old male left its home in a wildlife sanctuary in the western state of Maharashtra in June last year. He was possibly in search of prey, territory or a mate. Fitted with a radio collar, he travelled some 3,000 km (1,864 miles) through seven districts in Maharashtra and the neighbouring state of Telangana over nine months before ""settling down"" in another sanctuary in Maharashtra in March. The collar was removed in April. The 205-sqkm Dnyanganga sanctuary is home to leopards, blue bull, wild boar, peafowl and spotted deer. Walker is the only tiger living there, say wildlife officials.  ""He has no territorial issues. And he has adequate prey,"" Nitin Kakodkar, the senior-most forest official of Maharashtra state told the BBC.  Now wildlife officials are mulling whether they should move a female tiger to the sanctuary to give Walker a mating partner, a move which will be ""quite unprecedented"". Tigers are not solitary creatures, they say, and have a natural instinct to mate. However, moving a second tiger to the sanctuary is not going to be an easy decision. ""For one, it is not a big sanctuary. It is surrounded by farms and degraded forests. Also, if Walker breeds here, there will be pressure on prey and the new-born tigers will try to disperse,"" Mr Kakodkar said. India holds just 25% of total tiger habitat, but accounts for 70% of all remaining wild tigers, with around 3,000 animals. Tiger numbers have increased, but their habitat has shrunk and prey is not always plentiful, say experts.  Every tiger requires a breeding prey population of 500 animals in its territory to ensure a ""food bank"", say experts. Walker was fitted with a radio collar in February last year and continued to roam the forests until the onset of monsoon rains to ""find a suitable area to settle"".  Wildlife officials say the big cat did not travel in a ""linear manner"". He was tracked through GPS satellite information every hour and was recorded in more than 5,000 locations.  Over winter and much of this summer, Walker was tracked travelling back and forth over farms, along rivers, streams and highways. Winter is cotton growing season in Maharashtra, and the tall crop helped the cat to hide and walk through the farms. He mostly travelled at night, killing wild pigs and cattle for food. He came into conflict with humans only once, when it ""accidentally injured"" one person who traced his pugmarks to a thicket where he was resting. The man escaped with minor injuries. ""What this long walk demonstrates is that in spite of development and rising human population, the rural areas of Maharashtra are still conducive for tigers to move freely. Development, in that sense, still hasn't become a barrier to animal movement here,"" Dr Bilal Habib, a senior biologist with the Wildlife Institute of India, told the BBC.",2020-11-18T02:15:51,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-54973452,2020-11-18 08:21:43.019329,BBC,travel,0
What A Carve Up!: How an all-star lockdown hit is redefining theatre,"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter Before the pandemic, theatres in Huddersfield, Ipswich or Cirencester would not have dreamed of casting stars like Stephen Fry or Sir Derek Jacobi, or getting glowing reviews in the New York Times. But streaming has levelled the playing field and changed what a theatre show can be. The day Huddersfield's Lawrence Batley Theatre (LBT) closed for the first lockdown in March, the venue's management held a crisis meeting. They had enough money to pay salaries for one more month. They decided they ""weren't going to stop creating work"", though. ""If we were going to go down, we were going to go down in a blaze of creative glory,"" says artistic director and chief executive Henry Filloux-Bennett. In truth his 450-seat venue, in a former Methodist chapel, has always been mainly a stop-off for mid-scale touring productions, rather than a hothouse for home-grown shows. But like many theatres, when the pandemic began, it decided to shift its focus to streaming.  Eight months on, it has been more successful than most and recently released an innovative, star-studded and lucrative online production that was made on a shoestring budget. The adaptation of Jonathan Coe's 1994 novel What A Carve Up! features Fry, Jacobi, Alfred Enoch, Rebecca Front, Celia Imrie and Griff Rhys Jones. It's a cast Filloux-Bennett could never have assembled for a real-life run in West Yorkshire. Yet they were up for an online version - which, for most, involved recording their lines at home. Before that, Filloux-Bennett's adaption of cookery writer Nigel Slater's memoir Toast was streamed. So was his version of David Nicholls' novel The Understudy, which starred Fry, Mina Anwar, Emily Atack and Russell Tovey. Those two were essentially radio plays with animations adding ""a nice backdrop to every scene"". The Understudy raised funds for three theatre charities and will be performed live in the West End with a cast including Fry and James Norton for two nights in December, assuming the English lockdown isn't extended. Fry was the last to come on board for the online original, after Filloux-Bennett decided to pitch it to his agent days before they were due to announce the line-up. ""We'd had such success with the rest of the casting. I just Googled who Stephen Fry's agent was,"" he says. Within two hours, the actor had signed up. ""He has just been the most extraordinarily generous person with his time,"" says Filloux-Bennett. Fry then returned to provide the voice of publisher Patrick Mills in What A Carve Up!. ""We assumed we'd have one bite of the Fry cherry,"" Filloux-Bennett says. ""But I sent it over to him and he came back again almost immediately and said, 'Of course.' He's been amazing."" What A Carve Up! goes a step further with the visuals - Harry Potter and How to Get Away with Murder actor Enoch is seen on screen. So is Tamzin Outhwaite, playing an Emily Maitlis-style interviewer grilling a Paris Hilton-meets-Katie Hopkins character played by Fiona Button. The other actors' voiceovers are overlaid with a collage of animations, graphics and archive footage, cleverly coming together to relay Coe's combination of murder mystery and scathing social satire. It's a co-production between the LBT, the Barn in Cirencester and the New Wolsey in Ipswich and is directed by Tamara Harvey of Theatr Clwyd in Mold, north Wales. The result is ""murderously enjoyable"" according to the Daily Telegraph's five-star review, ""ingenious and gripping"" according to the Guardian, and ""a dizzying, inventive adaptation"" according to the i newspaper. The New York Times headline declared it ""wonderful"" before adding: ""But Is It Theatre?"" The newspaper's critic, Alexis Soloski, said the show was ""more like a true-crime podcast made fictional and visual through a series of tricky, starry YouTube videos with impressive literary pedigree"". Other reviewers also asked if the show should be described as theatre. ""Maybe not,"" wrote Quentin Letts in the Sunday Times. But the three collaborating venues ""haven't half shown up many bigger houses"" with their ""nimble, witty"" efforts, he went on. With live performances either difficult or impossible since March, many other agile theatre-makers have also been experimenting with recorded audio and video works that blur the traditional boundaries. And now the ""bigger houses"" are catching up. The National Theatre is turning one of its stages into a film set for a screen version of Romeo and Juliet starring Jessie Buckley and Josh O'Connor. Artistic director Rufus Norris told the Guardian it was ""very much a new form that we're discovering by the day"" and that it was ""great to be breaking a bit of new ground"". The question of whether such projects qualify as theatre bemuses Filloux-Bennett. ""We're baffled by that need to pigeonhole stuff quite that much,"" he says. ""The way I see it, our job is to tell stories. That's what you do in theatre. And we're just telling a story in a different medium because that's the only medium available to us at the moment. Is it theatre? Not probably in the definition of most people's understanding. But we didn't say it was."" What A Carve Up! is ""definitely not a film"" either, he adds. ""It's more like its own thing, and that's what we've been really excited about - creating something which is slightly not theatre, slightly not film, slightly not a radio play, slightly not really anything."" With a budget just over Â£15,000 and a two-month turnaround from starting the script to finishing the edit, it's certainly much cheaper and quicker than film or TV. ""That's what this situation has shown,"" says Filloux-Bennett. ""When you collaborate with amazing people, and you don't have much time or money, you can still create a pretty decent thing."" Standard tickets cost Â£12 and the show earned more than Â£40,000 in its first week, giving the LBT and its two sister theatres a welcome financial fillip. With funding from Arts Council England and Kirklees Council plus almost Â£250,000 from the government's Culture Recovery Fund, Filloux-Bennett says his venue has avoided having to lay off any of its 35 staff, has continued paying its 60 to 70 casual employees, and can stay afloat ""easily through to the next financial year"". In the future, Filloux-Bennett believes streaming and real-life shows can go hand-in-hand. ""We've managed to make as much as we can of a really terrible situation, and that has been to the benefit of our reputation as a theatre,"" he says. The past eight months have also made him rethink the role of a regional theatre. The schedule of touring productions may not return until 2022 or 2023, he thinks, so his venue will make more shows - live and online - with and for the local community. ""We're just going to have to be responsive and be quite scrappy and ambitious in terms of creating our own work,"" he says. Smaller theatres have shown themselves to be more adaptable in a crisis than major venues, he says. ""The thing that lockdown has shown is that the bigger you are, the slower you are able to respond to stuff, and I think that is a really valuable lesson for a lot of places. ""Because we can be a bit more fleet of foot, we're the ones who have shown what we can do."" What A Carve Up! is available to stream until 29 November.

"Covid: SMS requests to go out, red zones - Europe's lockdown","Measures to deal with coronavirus outbreaks are in place across Europe. Many involve the reintroduction of restrictions that had been eased after initial lockdowns. France is under a second national lockdown until at least 1 December.  People can only leave home to go to work, buy essential goods, seek medical help or exercise for one hour a day. Anyone going outside must carry a written statement justifying their journey. All non-essential shops, restaurants and bars are shut, but schools and creches remain open.  Social gatherings are banned. Until 30 November, social contacts are limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people. Cinemas, theatres, gyms, pools and saunas, restaurants and bars (except for takeaways) are closed, but schools, creches, shops and hairdressers are all open. Large events are cancelled and fans cannot attend sports fixtures, but church services are permitted.  Overnight leisure stays in hotels are banned and non-essential travel is strongly discouraged. A new three-tier framework and further nationwide restrictions are now in force. The red zones - areas with the most infections - have closed all bars, restaurants and most shops, including hairdressers and beauticians. Factories and essential services, including pharmacies and supermarkets, have remained open. In orange zones, restaurants and bars have closed, but hairdressers and beauty salons are open. In green zones, restaurants and bars can stay open until 18:00, but museums, theatres, cinemas, gyms and swimming pools are closed, as in the rest of the country.   There is a nationwide curfew from 22:00 to 05:00, gatherings for weddings, baptisms and funerals are banned, older school pupils have switched to remote learning, and masks must be worn everywhere, except at home. Spain is under a nationwide curfew and state of emergency until early May 2021. With the exception of the Canary Islands, everyone must stay at home between 23:00 and 06:00. People are only allowed out in that period to go to work, buy medicine, or care for elderly people or children.  Regional leaders can modify the curfew's start and end times in their territory and can also close regional borders for travel.  Public and private gatherings are limited to six people, while anyone aged over six must wear a face covering on public transport and in indoor public spaces nationwide. They are also compulsory outdoors in many regions.  From 23 November, anyone travelling to Spain must have a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours.  Until mid-December, all non-essential shops and businesses offering personal services such as hairdressing are closed. Other shops must close by 22:00 and alcohol sales are prohibited after 20:00.  All bars, cafes and restaurants are also closed, but can offer takeaways until 22:00. Hotel restaurants and bars can only provide room service.  Masks must be worn everywhere and groups meeting outside are limited to four people.  In Wallonia and Brussels, there is a nightly curfew from 22:00 to 06:00, with exceptions for urgent medical care and commuters. In Flanders, the curfew runs from 00:00 to 05:00.  Gyms, pools and other cultural and leisure facilities are closed, Christmas markets, winter villages, second-hand markets and public events like festivals are not allowed, and sports fans cannot attend fixtures. About 70% of the country's population, including people in Lisbon and Porto, are affected by restrictions which only allow them to leave home for work, school or other essential tasks. There is a curfew from 23:00 to 05:00 and movement between Portugal's municipalities is prohibited. All commercial establishments must close by 23:00 and alcohol cannot be sold in shops and petrol stations after 20:00. Alcohol can only be drunk in public places with a meal. Gatherings are limited to a maximum of five people, but up to 50 are allowed at weddings and baptisms.  By 20:00 all shops apart from supermarkets must close. Alcohol cannot be sold after that time.  Bars, restaurants and coffee shops are closed, apart from takeaways,  Public meetings of more than two people from different households are banned and museums, theatres, cinemas, zoos and amusement parks are closed.  Masks will become compulsory in all public indoor spaces from 1 December, and must be worn already on public transport and in shops.  Schools, gyms, swimming pools and saunas are open, and under-18s can continue playing amateur sports.  Restrictions in place until 20 November mean services, schools and shops, with the exception of those selling essential supplies, are closed and people can only leave homes for essential reasons. The first two years of primary school will return on 18 November, with pupils wearing face coverings at all times, including during lessons.  Seven North Jutland provinces are in lockdown because of a coronavirus mutation found in mink that can spread to humans. Across the country, until 2 January, alcohol sales after 22:00 are banned. A maximum of 10 people can attend gatherings, and masks are compulsory in all indoor public places.  Other local restrictions, like the closure of bars, restaurants and nightclubs in Copenhagen and surrounding areas at 22:00, are in place until 2 January. No social or family gatherings are allowed in homes or gardens but people can meet outdoors with one other household, for example to exercise, but only within 5km (about three miles) from home. Many non-essential shops and hairdressers are closed and bars and restaurants can only sell takeaways. Weddings and funerals are limited to 25 and 10 people respectively.  However, schools and creches remain open and construction and elite sport can continue. During the current lockdown, which runs until 30 November, people must get permission to leave home by sending SMS messages for daily requirements.  A nationwide curfew runs from 21:00 to 05:00, while travel between regions is banned. Shops and secondary schools are shut,and nurseries and primary schools must close from Monday.   People coming to Greece must provide a negative coronavirus test.  From 20 November, all licensed bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol by 22:00 and close by 22:30. Masks in Sweden are still not recommended, but a maximum of eight people per table can sit together in cafes and restaurants. There are other measures which the government advises, but they are only voluntary.",2020-11-14T21:02:58,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53640249,2020-11-16 08:11:37.073145,BBC,travel,0
Covid: What are the latest rules for international travel?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News Current rules in England and Wales mean that people are not currently allowed to travel abroad for a holiday.  Foreign travel is only permitted for work, education or if someone has another valid reason. In England, leaving home in order to travel for holidays can be punished by a fine, with penalties starting at Â£200 and going up to Â£6,400. Even if this were not the case, travellers from the UK face restrictions in many countries when they arrive. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, people arriving in the UK from anywhere in Greece, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos, will have to self-isolate for two weeks. The ban on travellers from Denmark is being extended for another 14 days. But people travelling from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar, and the Turks and Caicos Islands will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival from Saturday morning. Before the current lockdown, there were only a handful of places travellers from England could visit without facing restrictions - either when they arrived at their destination, or on their return. These include: Many of these destinations require visitors to submit forms several days before departure. There are separate exemption lists for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Travellers from the common travel area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - are exempt from UK quarantine. However, some parts of the CTA, including Ireland and the Isle of Man, impose restrictions on travellers entering from England. A major consideration for travellers from the UK is whether they will have to quarantine on their return.  Employers do not have to pay statutory sick pay to people who are self-isolating because they have been on a foreign holiday.  Travellers returning to England do not have to quarantine on arrival if the country they have been in, is on the government's travel corridor list. This list is updated every week, and countries can be taken on or off, depending on the latest data on coronavirus.  There are hopes coronavirus testing for passengers could make travel to more destinations possible, by providing proof of a negative result. In the UK, Heathrow is offering an Â£80 pre-flight coronavirus test on flights to Hong Kong, which requires a recent negative test for entry from the UK. The rapid saliva swab is available on some British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific flights from Terminals 2 and 5, and is known as a Lamp (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification). Several countries, such as Greece, Cyprus, the Bahamas and Bermuda, will not accept the results of a Lamp test, which unlike the NHS-preferred PCR test, does not require analysis in a lab.  These tests are only for passengers departing the UK. But ministers say they could soon formally approve the idea of arrivals paying for a test after a week of self-isolation. This would lead to early release from quarantine if they are negative. People will have to pay for their own private tests. Health is a devolved policy, meaning each UK nation sets its own quarantine list. These have generally been identical, although at some points Scotland and Wales have both applied quarantine measures to countries when England and Northern Ireland did not.",2020-11-12T17:12:51,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53221896,2020-11-13 14:41:22.705590,BBC,travel,0
Nasa SpaceX mission: Dragon capsule docks with space station,"The four astronauts who left Earth on Monday (GMT) have arrived at the International Space Station (ISS). Their SpaceX Dragon capsule made a series of inch-perfect manoeuvres to bring them into an attachment position on the front of the orbiting lab. Commander Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker, Victor Glover and Soichi Noguchi will be spending the next six months aloft. They join three individuals already aboard - Kate Rubins, Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Raising the resident complement to seven individuals will triple the amount of microgravity science that can be conducted on the 410km-high outpost, the US space agency Nasa says. The Dragon docked at 04:01, just as the station was flying over the US state of Idaho. The incoming crew had to wait for seal and pressure checks before the hatches between the Dragon and the ISS could be opened. But once this was completed, they were able to enter their new home. Mike Hopkins said his team had had an amazing ride up from Earth. ""I can't tell you how excited we were when that rocket lifted off the pad, and then the last 27 hours have gone really smooth,"" he radioed down to Earth.  ""We are so excited to be here. We are humbled and we are excited to be a part of this great expedition. And we are looking forward to the next six months and can't wait to get started."" The capsule commander and his colleagues are the first crew rotation to be brought up to the station on a fully certified, commercial human transportation system. The Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule they used to get off Earth is a service the Californian firm SpaceX now sells to Nasa. And the agency has a contract with the company for a further five crew rotations after this one. It's a new way of doing business for Nasa, who always used to own and operate the hardware needed to get astronauts into low-Earth orbit. Now that the agency can source taxi rides from a private supplier, it is focussing its efforts on developing a rocket and capsule for the more challenging task of taking people back to the Moon, something it hopes to do later this decade. Hopkins' team has a full programme of research ahead of it. An example experiment involves chips with tissue that mimics the structure and function of human organs, to try to understand the role of microgravity on human health and disease. The crew will go on at least four spacewalks outside the station.  One of these activities is expected to result in the installation of the first significant UK industrial contribution to the platform. This is the ColKa communications terminal. Made by MDA UK, the radio equipment will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. ColKa will be fixed to the exterior of the European Space Agency's ISS research module, Columbus. The crew will also see a wide variety of space vehicles come and go during their time aboard.  Among these vehicles should be the Boeing aerospace corporation's Starliner capsule.  Like the SpaceX Dragon ship, Starliner is being offered to Nasa and its partner agencies on a commercial basis to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS. ""Low-Earth orbit for over 50 years was the domain of governments. Now, we've seen commercial companies, SpaceX being the first, take astronauts to the space station, with Boeing set to follow, hopefully sometime next year,"" commented former Nasa astronaut Leroy Chiao.  ""It very much follows the aviation era where airliners used to be government run, and now of course they've been commercial for a number of decades,"" the shuttle and Soyuz flier told BBC News.",2020-11-17T04:09:01,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54966180,2020-11-17 09:52:10.734807,BBC,technology,0
Ethiopia Tigray crisis: Rights commission to investigate 'mass killings',"Ethiopia's human rights commission has said it will send a team to investigate reports of mass killings of civilians in the northern Tigray state. The commission, appointed by the government but independent, said it was aware of reports of ""ethnic profiling"" being undertaken in the area. PM Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre. Its officials have denied involvement.  The UN human rights chief warned the killings could amount to war crimes. Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera), a town in the South West Zone of Tigray. There have been long-standing tensions between Ethiopia's government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state.  Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military operation against the TPLF earlier this month after he accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops - claims the TPLF also deny. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray. The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. The human rights group Amnesty International, said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"" on 9 November. It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from. Witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"", Amnesty said. Getting independently verified information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down. Mr Abiy said that fighters backing the TPLF went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra. Some witnesses also said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"". In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.  It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.  The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there. By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.  There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed. In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders. On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region. I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.  I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.  As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible. ",2020-11-14T06:44:27,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-54941833,2020-11-14 11:07:54.945791,BBC,world,0
Civil war massacre 'cover-up' exposed by historian,"A ""frenzied"" massacre, which may have included women and children, has been almost forgotten due to a cover-up, a historian has claimed. About 160 died when Parliamentary troops stormed the Royalist stronghold of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, in 1645. Dr David Appleby believes the presence of ""European Catholics"" among the dead and unease over the bloodshed led to the battle later being hushed up. He said: ""Shelford was covered up by both sides.""  ""The Parliamentarians wanted to forget the savagery, the Royalists, the use of unpopular foreign troops,"" he added. Dr Appleby, from the University of Nottingham's history department, said he was prompted to research Shelford as it did not appear in histories of the war, but he noticed it mentioned in contemporary documents asking for financial aid. Shelford was a moated manor between Nottingham and the Royalist fortress of Newark. The war began in 1642 between supporters of King Charles I's absolute rule and those who believed parliament should run England. In the aftermath of Charles's decisive defeat at Naseby in June 1645, Parliamentary forces looked to mop up areas of resistance. ""Some of Charles' battered army were billeted at Shelford, namely the Queen's Regiment who were mainly European Catholics with a very bad reputation among fellow Royalists, as well as the xenophobic and anti-Catholic parliamentarian press,"" said Dr Appleby. Dr Appleby said the attackers were ""in a state of frenzy"". ""Records of the Royalist casualties are vague, but it's estimated [the defending commander} died with the bulk of his garrison,"" he said. ""Their bodies were perhaps mutilated after death and buried together in hastily-dug pits somewhere near the battle site.  ""There is also a claim in a petition... that several women and children in the garrison had also been murdered."" He believed while some women were soldiers' wives, others joined the army on the road. ""They worked as nurses, cooks, companions, and it has to be said that prostitution was very common,"" he said. Despite the blood-letting, the battle quickly disappeared from the written record. Dr Appleby said: ""It is... perhaps a reflection of both sides' shame and embarrassment at the bloodshed and viciousness of the supposedly 'civil' Civil Wars.""

Do these Republican voters accept election result?,"By Sam CabralBBC News, Washington Over 72 million Americans voted in favour of a second term for President Donald Trump. But despite falling short of victory, many of his supporters say they are not ready to move on. Although allegations of widespread electoral fraud are unsubstantiated, about 70% of Republican voters do not believe Democrat Joe Biden won a ""free and fair"" election, according to a Politico/ Morning Consult poll.  The Trump campaign has requested recounts, filed lawsuits and amplified the suspicions of upset supporters.  President-elect Biden's victory will not be solidified until the electoral college meets in mid-December, and many Republicans expect the result to be overturned. We asked Trump voters what they make of the election result. Here's what they said: Rom Solene is a Marine Corps veteran and history buff who voted for Donald Trump in 2020 much more enthusiastically than he did in 2016. He is disappointed that Trump lost, but says Trump gave a lot of voters ""reason to believe in the Republican party again"" and neither the Republican party nor Joe Biden can afford to dismiss people like himself.  Of course I accept the result! To do otherwise would be to not accept the ideals the United States was founded upon. I'm disappointed. However, I take solace in knowing that many votes that were cast for Mr Biden were actually votes that were cast against Mr Trump. Which is to say a lot of people did not vote for Mr Biden; rather, they voted against Mr Trump. I personally know a lot of people who believe in Mr Trump's policies but they disdained his personality or style. I think Mr Biden sees that as well, which is why he's been quick to state that he will govern on behalf of those who didn't vote for him as much as those who did. Mr Biden will never make a decision as President without carefully considering how his decision will impact that large voting bloc that supported Mr Trump. I will only stick with the Republican party of the last four years. That is the Republican party that epitomises my beliefs. The Republican party of the last 30 years was Republican In Name Only (Rinos). Cat Lewis is a Christian writer who avidly supports Donald Trump and attended his 2017 inauguration with her whole family. She says that, unlike other politicians, Trump was ""in it for what he can give"" not what he can get. She has several concerns about the integrity of the election and is not yet prepared to concede that Joe Biden has won.  I'm suspicious of the result. ALL the states with questionable mail-in ballots are Democratic-controlled swing states. It amazes me how many ballot count overseers were not able to see the counting, in my opinion. If everything is on the up and up, why are Republican overseers not given full access inside counting rooms? Something is fishy. I'm eager to see how the recounts will go. I'm sad for our country if Biden has actually won because Trump is the one. He's the man. He stands up for the little people. He doesn't take China's money or collude with other nations against the US. He's the one keeping us safe and making life better for everyone. If we only read his accomplishments and didn't know who enacted them, as Americans, we must say with honesty that his achievements have been blessings to this country. He's done amazing work IF YOU ONLY LOOK AT HIS ACTIONS. But, you have to ignore the media and liberals who want us to hate ""the bad orange man."" Doubtful. They have not supported Trump, and for that, I am changing my voter registration to Independent. If Trump is not re-elected, I'm eager to see what he will do. I'm sure he's not done just because he's not the president. Jim Sullivan is a property manager who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020 because he supports the core ideology and policies of the Republican Party. Over the past few years, he has worked to help the party at the state and local level, an activity he is keen to return to now that the election is over. Yes... barring any serious evidence to the contrary. I accept the certified results of the election and the media-projected winners.   My feelings have ranged from sadness to relief to acceptance. I have a new sense of purpose. I am ready for change. Yes absolutely! I will definitely stick with the Republican party. Now, is the perfect time to re-group, re-build, re-focus ourselves and return to our roots! My support was never tied to a person. It is tied to an ideology - the Republican way of life. Sure, I supported Trump as the head of our party and also as the head of our country, but in my mind there is a hierarchy of loyalty. Above Trump is our party and beyond that is our nation and the Constitution of the USA. Mike Harlow is an outspoken gay YouTuber who did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016, but says Trump earned his vote with his policies over the past four years. He called Mr Trump ""the most misunderstood president in modern history."" The election is not over yet, says Mike, but - win or lose - the Trump coalition will not allow his agenda to fall by the wayside. I will 100% accept the results after there are full recounts and investigations of the unprecedented irregularities that have taken place. There are many whistleblowers coming forward and ""glitches"" being reported. We need transparency. Biden supporters deserve that as well. If after all investigations and recounts are completed, there is no reason to believe that there was any widespread fraud, I will wish my new president well and show him the respect that Democrats never showed their president for the last 4 years. I am truly devastated by this election. Maybe it was naive, but I trusted the electoral process. That is no longer the case. There are too many suspicious things taking place. However, this is not a loss. Not one single state has yet certified Joe Biden as the winner. We do not have an official result yet. More importantly, there is much cause for celebration here. President Trump received the highest non-white vote of any Republican in 60 years. Never again will Democrats and the left be allowed to act like they own and  control all minorities in America. Absolutely. I have a love-hate relationship with my party. If this were the same Republican party of 10 to 20 years ago, I would never be a Republican. My goal is to help change the Republican party from within. I will do everything humanly possible to ensure that the old Republican party doesn't come back from the grave. We will not go back to the Republican party acting as a country club for a handful of elites. This was always about taking on the Republican establishment just as much as the left. Scott Nolan is a criminal defence attorney and Navy veteran who voted for Donald Trump again because he was impressed with several of his policy moves over the past four years. He could not stand Hillary Clinton and, although he had no such objection to Joe Biden, he fears that Biden ""is not strong in character"". Nolan says he will move on when the final result is certified. I'll accept the result when made official, yes. AND I'll wish the President well. It doesn't matter that I didn't vote for him. I always wish the President of the United States well and pray that I was wrong about him. The United States has now entered its most dangerous period in more than a century and a half. We have begun to curtail the rights of free citizens under the guise of granting entitlements to others. The sheer nastiness with which the left treated the president and us, his supporters, has curtailed the very hope of unity the President-Elect tried to call for. If there is a road back to unity, I confess I do not see it. We have reached a point from which there is no turning back. Yes, I will stick with the Republican party so long as they stick to their support of the constitution, limited government and a strong military.",2020-11-13T00:37:20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54922924,2020-11-13 14:33:32.507533,BBC,politics,0
US election 2020: Biden takes Georgia to solidify victory,"US President-elect Joe Biden has won the state of Georgia, the BBC projects, the first Democratic candidate to do so since 1992. The win solidifies Mr Biden's victory, giving him a total of 306 votes in the electoral college, the system the US uses to choose its president. President Donald Trump is projected to win North Carolina, reaching 232 votes. Mr Trump, who has not yet conceded, alluded for the first time to a possible new administration in January. Looking subdued, the president stopped short of acknowledging his defeat during a briefing of his coronavirus task force at the White House, his first public appearance since his election defeat was projected by US media.  As the country faces growing outbreaks of Covid-19, Mr Trump said he would not impose a lockdown to fight the virus, adding: ""Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell."" The president, who did not mention Mr Biden by name, did not take questions from reporters. Pressure is growing on Mr Trump, a Republican, to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. The results in Georgia and North Carolina were the last to be projected in the race for the White House. Mr Biden's electoral votes equal the tally Mr Trump achieved in his victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. At the time Mr Trump referred to it as ""a landslide"". President Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. But his efforts suffered three setbacks on Friday: A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but the Biden team said they did not expect it to change the results there. Joe Biden did not have to win Georgia or Arizona to secure the White House. His recapturing of the ""blue wall"" northern industrial states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by themselves assured his victory.  The former vice-president's success in these Sun Belt states - the first time a Democrat has won either in decades - suggests, however, that Democrats may be clearing a new path to presidential success in future elections.  If so, it would make Democrats less dependent on the kind of non-college-educated white voters in those northern battlegrounds that, given Donald Trump's appeal, may be trending toward the Republicans. It was educated suburban voters, as well as traditionally Democratic ethnic minorities, that delivered Georgia and Arizona to Mr Biden. It is not all good news for the Democrats, however. Donald Trump did win North Carolina - another southern swing state - even though it was carried by Barack Obama in 2008. The electoral map is shifting, and the parties will have to adjust their strategies accordingly. In the meantime, Georgia - which has two January run-off elections that will decide control of the US Senate - will take centre stage in the months ahead.  Joe Biden's narrow victory there all but assures it will be a hotly contested battle. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. Meanwhile, the Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access"". Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security. ""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"" he told Politico. Earlier, a group of more than 150 former national security officials urged the GSA to officially recognise Mr Biden so that they could access ""pressing national security issues"". A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. Mr Trump continued to dispute the election result with a series of tweets on Friday, without providing evidence for his claims of fraud. He also suggested he might join his supporters at a rally planned in Washington on Saturday. His messages came hours after election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. The statement from the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council was released after Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence. The claim appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News (OANN) and was flagged by Twitter as disputed.  On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term"".

Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe dies,"The Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has died at the age of 74. The serial killer was serving a whole life term for murdering 13 women across Yorkshire and north-west England. His first victim's son, who was five when his mother was killed in 1975, said Sutcliffe's death would bring ""some kind of closure"". The former lorry driver, from Bradford, died in hospital where he is said to have refused treatment for Covid-19. He also had other health problems. Sutcliffe, who was also found guilty of the attempted murder of seven women, was convicted in 1981.  He spent three decades at Broadmoor Hospital before being moved to HMP Frankland in County Durham in 2016. Ex-police officer Bob Bridgestock, who worked on the case, said he ""won't be shedding any tears"" over the killer's death. The murders, which spanned five years from 1975 to 1980, began with 28-year-old mother-of-four Wilma McCann, who was hit with a hammer and stabbed 15 times, in October 1975. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times during the course of a huge investigation but continued to avoid arrest and was able to carry on with his killings. Ms McCann's son Richard said: ""The attention he's had over the years, the continuous news stories that we've suffered over the years, there is some form of conclusion to that. ""I am sure a lot of the families, surviving children of the victims may well be glad he has gone and they have a right to feel like that."" He explained that in about 2010 he had decided to let go of his anger and ""forgive"" Sutcliffe. ""I am sorry to hear he has passed away. It's not something I could have said in the past when I was consumed with anger,"" he said. Sutcliffe was dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper because he mutilated his victims' bodies using a hammer, screwdriver and knife. He is said to have believed he was on a ""mission from God"" to kill prostitutes, although not all of his victims were sex workers. One of his surviving victims said that 44 years on she still suffers from the effects of his attack in Leeds. Marcella Claxton told Sky News: ""I have to live with my injuries, 54 stitches in my head, back and front, plus I lost a baby, I was four months pregnant. ""I still get headaches, dizzy spells and black outs."" An inquiry held after his conviction said a backlog of case paperwork meant officers were unable to connect vital pieces of information. The first two victims, Ms McCann and Emily Jackson, were killed in Chapeltown, which was known at the time for containing Leeds' main red light district. Following the second murder, West Yorkshire Police announced they were looking for a ""prostitute killer"", leading to accusations key eyewitness evidence was being ignored as it did not fit detectives' narrative.  The investigation was also misdirected by one of criminal history's cruellest hoaxes, when John Humble tricked police into believing the serial killer was a man dubbed Wearside Jack because of his gruff Sunderland accent. Police had believed he was the killer despite the victims of Sutcliffe who survived said their attacker sounded like he was a local man. Humble, who died in 2019, never fully explained why he taunted the press and detectives with letters and an infamous tape recording, in which he anonymously claimed to be the serial killer. West Yorkshire Police detectives, headed by the then assistant chief constable George Oldfield, believed the letters and tape were genuine and diverted resources to the north east of England.  When Humble was eventually prosecuted, Leeds Crown Court heard claims the delays caused by the hoax left Peter Sutcliffe free to murder three more women. Sutcliffe had violently attacked at least three women before he killed Ms McCann. In 1969, he hit a woman over the head with a stone in a sock. Sutcliffe admitted the offence, but his victim decided not to press charges. Six years later, just months before Ms McCann's death, he attacked two other women with a knife and a hammer but both survived. Mo Lea, who was attacked aged 20 as she walked home from a pub in Leeds in October 1980, said she had written Sutcliffe a letter while he was in prison. ""I was compelled to write to Peter Sutcliffe to let him know how the fact that he was hanging on to the knowledge that he tried to kill me, was affecting me,"" she said.  ""And I thought at least if I post it I'll know that in some way there'll be a level of understanding. I didn't expect a response and I didn't get one but it felt good to put it in the postbox."" Mr Oldfield's 200-strong ripper squad eventually carried out more than 130,000 interviews, visited more than 23,000 homes and checked 150,000 cars. But a stroke of luck led to Sutcliffe's arrest when his brown Rover car, which had false number plates, was stopped by police in a red light area of Sheffield in January 1981.  Mr Bridgestock, who was one of the first on the scene when Josephine Whitaker was murdered in 1979, said senior detectives ""wore blinkers"" while leading the inquiry.  ""It's the victims that served the life sentence and then the victims' families that really serve the true life sentences,"" he said. ""For them today, they will have some kind of closure."" Mr McCann appealed to West Yorkshire Police to make a formal apology for the language used to describe his mother and other victims in the 1970s. ""They described some of the women as 'innocent', inferring that some were not innocent - including my mum,"" he said.  ""She was a family woman who, through no fault of her own, was going through adversity and made some bad decisions, some risky decisions."" ""She paid for those decisions with her life."" A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ""We have received correspondence from Mr McCann and commit to continue to engage with him directly.""",2020-11-13T12:56:59,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-54874713,2020-11-13 14:24:53.345027,BBC,world,0
Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain: PM's top aides leave No 10,"Two of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior aides have left Downing Street for the last time after internal battles over their roles. Chief adviser Dominic Cummings and director of communications Lee Cain will work out their notices at home following tensions within No 10. Lord Lister will become interim chief of staff pending a wide-ranging shake-up of the prime minister's team. Senior Conservative MP David Davis said the PM had taken ""decisive action"". Mr Davis, a former Brexit Secretary, said the decision would have been hard for Mr Johnson but said it offered a chance to ""reset government"". He said: ""Lots of my colleagues are hoping for a new relationship. More openness and interaction with Parliament, and I am told the cabinet is hoping to get more say as it were in events."" The departure of Mr Cummings and Mr Cain comes as trade talks between the UK and the EU on a future relationship reach a ""make or break"" point - with crucial differences proving hard to resolve ahead of a looming deadline for a deal. The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson was not distracted by the row, and was ""focused"" on getting the country through the coronavirus pandemic. Other senior Conservatives have welcomed the changes in the team surrounding the prime minister. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith wrote in the Daily Telegraph that Mr Cummings' influence at No 10 had led to ""a ramshackle operation in the hands of one man"". Another MP said was it was time to ""rejoice"" at the departure of the two aides, the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young reported. Lord Gavin Barwell, who was former Prime Minister Theresa May's chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was an opportunity for Mr Johnson to rebuild relations with Conservative MPs and ""set a less confrontational and more unifying tone that is maybe more in tune with his natural instincts"". Both Mr Cummings, 48, and Mr Cain, 39, are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign and worked closely with Mr Johnson to deliver the Brexit vote during the 2016 EU referendum.  Mr Cain will be replaced by James Slack, who is currently the prime minister's official spokesman. Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt said there were conflicting accounts of the final meeting involving Mr Johnson and his two departing aides. The prime minister's team reportedly learned that Mr Cummings' team had described him as indecisive and also allegedly briefed against the prime minister's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds.  Mr Johnson is said to have expressed his displeasure during a meeting with the two men, but their side disputes this - with a source saying the three had a very friendly and warm meeting. Mr Cummings prompted controversy this summer after it emerged he made a 260-mile trip from London to County Durham with his family at the height of the UK's first coronavirus lockdown. The adviser later said the journey was intended to secure childcare, but he was mocked for claiming a subsequent outing to the picturesque town of Barnard Castle was to help test his eyesight. Mr Cummings had a notoriously difficult relationship with Conservative MPs, some of whom said it was time for things to be done differently in Downing Street. ""Both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers and sometimes ministers and secretaries of state, and I don't think that was helpful,"" former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers said. She added: ""I do think it's important that whoever takes over has a different approach."" Jill Rutter, senior research fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said Mr Cummings had been ""disproportionately influential"" but the year he had been in Downing Street would not have been long enough to carry out long-term reform. She said: ""Ultimately it is up to the prime minister who he appoints as his adviser, and advisers only get any authority from the prime minister, so you have to assume that what Dominic Cummings was doing was what the prime minister wanted him to do, up until he didn't which is what appears to have happened yesterday."" Labour said the PM could ""rearrange the deckchairs all he wants... but the responsibility for this government's incompetence still lies firmly at Boris Johnson's door"". ""The fact there is no plan and no focus in the government's response to Covid is entirely down to him,"" a party source said.  Mr Cain, who resigned on Thursday, is said to have left Downing Street through a discreet exit on Friday evening. But Mr Cummings walked through the black front door of No 10 with a cardboard box and was later seen arriving home with a bottle of champagne.",2020-11-14T09:33:09,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54941846,2020-11-14 11:05:41.471113,BBC,politics,0
Birmingham violence: The three teenagers killed days apart,"By Steve Swann and Thomas MackintoshBBC News When Sidali Mohamed left his maths lesson a few minutes early on 13 February last year, he seemed happy. The 16-year-old was going to pick up his younger brother.  It was a journey he didn't get to complete.  Sidali was murdered outside the gates of his college by a boy the same age as him.  He was the first of three Birmingham teenagers who were stabbed within 12 days of each other last February. They died within 10 days of one another.  These cases fell into a BBC project, tracking the first 100 killings of 2019.  Our aim was to dig into the detail to understand why homicide had increased in the previous three years.  We discovered a high number of stabbings and the prevalence of young murder victims and perpetrators.  Nearly a quarter of the 100 people we identified as responsible for the killings were teenagers.  The three Birmingham murders led the local police chief to talk of a ""national knife crime emergency"" and once again highlighted the problem of serious youth violence. And this week, a report by the Commons Justice Committee said violence-against-the-person offences by children have increased by 10% over the last decade.   Sidali Mohamed had been brought to Britain as a young boy by his family as refugees fleeing violence in Somalia.  Despite the heroic efforts of his teachers and medical staff, he died in a Birmingham hospital two days after he was attacked. He had been studying to become an accountant and was described by his parents as ""a role model to his younger brothers"".  Sidali's violent, premature death left a ""huge void"" in the family. His killer, Louai Ali, was subsequently jailed for at least 19 years.  A trial heard how he blamed Sidali for problems his cousin was having with some students at Joseph Chamberlain College in Highgate, Birmingham. Wearing a balaclava and gloves and carrying a 10-inch, two-pronged zombie knife he had bought for Â£50 on Instagram, Ali waited outside the college gates.  CCTV captured what happened next. He punched Sidali, fracturing his jaw.  Following a tussle on the grass, Ali plunged the knife into Sidali's chest.  The attack, witnessed by dozens of students, was over within a minute.  Like the boy whose life he claimed, Ali had also shown great potential.  He represented England as an amateur junior boxer.  Someone who knew him at his local gym but did not want to be identified told the BBC he ""could have gone far in the boxing world"".  ""The young lads and girls looked up to him.""  But Ali couldn't contain violence to the ring.  As his life spiralled out of control, he picked up convictions for robbery and battery.  A video circulated on social media showed him assaulting a girl in a fast-food restaurant.  In another he boasted of being the ""blood-clot boxer"". At the time of the murder he was on police bail following a serious incident when he almost killed his neighbour, Russ Molloy.  Mr Molloy had challenged the teenager after he saw him and some friends smoking cannabis near young children.  After that, ""when our paths crossed he would intimidate me,"" Mr Molloy told the BBC.  ""I was always trying to be the grown-up and defuse it - he was just a kid.  ""But he didn't listen. He was uneducated. It's the influences he had around him."" In December 2018, Ali and another man launched a ferocious assault on Mr Molloy, cornering him near his home and slicing his arm with a long knife.  ""It could have been me [who was killed], so I count myself lucky,"" Mr Molloy said. But he is angry that Ali wasn't placed in custody while the case was investigated.  Instead, less than two months later, he killed Sidali Mohamed.  Mr Molloy can forgive Ali for attacking him, but says: ""I don't think anyone else can forgive for taking a life. That's a step beyond my forgiveness."" Within five days of Sidali's murder another 16-year-old Birmingham boy was murdered.  Abdullah Muhammad was strolling in a park before attending prayers at his mosque when he was stabbed three times during a robbery.  Three men have since been sentenced for the ""horrific"" and ""unprovoked"" attack. Abdullah's father paid tribute in court to his son, saying: ""He was a loving, respectable and hard-working young man who would always look out for and always help his brothers and sisters, who clearly looked up to him in admiration."" The following week, yet another college student, Hazrat Umar, 18, was fatally stabbed in the city.  His life was ""extinguished over a petty disagreement"", a court was told.   Hazrat was walking to the gym when he was set upon by Adam Muhammed, a fellow student two years younger than him.  The pair had had a row earlier and Muhammed skipped an exam to exact his revenge.  He repeatedly plunged a huge blade into his victim, stamped on him and left him to die in the street.  Muhammad admitted murder and was sentenced to life, with a minimum term of 14 years and three months. Hazrat's uncle is Nazir Afzal, former chief prosecutor in the north west of England, who said: ""Hazrat was one of those people who quite frankly warmed a room when he walked in. He was cheerful, joyful. He was absolutely adored by his own family and extended family."" ""My family's grief is repeated, as your survey has found, dozens and dozens of times every year,"" said Mr Afzal in reference to the BBC's 100 killings research. We also discovered the number of teenage homicide suspects has risen to a five-year high.  That's according to figures obtained from freedom of information requests across 22 police force areas.  Whilst the numbers fluctuate over time, recent incidents have led the government to push for longer prison terms for teenage killers.  Despite his grief, Nazir Afzal says this is not the answer. ""Punish them. Yes, try to deter other people. But also at the back of the judge's mind must be the view that this person can still make a contribution to society once they are finally released.""",2020-11-13T03:12:28,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54897292,2020-11-13 14:33:57.440471,BBC,world,0
Newspaper headlines: Covid contracts 'concern' and 'plan to save Christmas',"By BBC NewsStaff The launch of the government's ""green industrial revolution"" is the lead for several papers - with the Times and the Mail focusing on the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.  The Mail says it's to start a decade earlier than originally planned - and its headline emphasises that the change is not far off: ""End of road for petrol and diesel cars in just nine years."" But the paper also points out that with electric vehicles costing far more than conventional models, the plan could hit the poor. At present, the Times explains, the upfront cost of electric cars can be about Â£10,000 above petrol and diesel equivalents, mainly because of battery production. Writing in the Financial Times, Boris Johnson says his plan will turn the UK into the world's number one centre for green technology and finance, creating the foundations for decades of economic growth. Jeremy Corbyn's reinstatement to the Labour Party is the main story for the Telegraph.  It says Sir Keir Starmer is facing mutiny from his MPs over the move - and at least one MP is threatening to resign if the whip is restored to him.  The Guardian chooses as its main story the National Audit Office report that says PPE suppliers with political connections were directed to a ""high-priority"" channel for UK government contracts. According to the paper, the report found that almost 500 suppliers were referred to the channel, where their pitches for contracts were automatically treated as credible. The Telegraph reports that France is understood to have accepted that its fishing rights in UK waters would be reduced after the Brexit transition period ends - lowering one of the biggest hurdles in the path of a trade deal. The paper says it's understood that both sides are working from common texts and recently exchanged proposals over fishing rights. A source on the British side of the negotiations is quoted as saying: ""It could be clear by Monday or Tuesday whether we are going to get a deal"". Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The Express, the i and the Sun lead on what a normal Christmas might look like this year. According to the Sun, the aim is to bring the UK under a common rule that would allow households to mix indoors for a limited period. It says ministers are considering reuniting families over a run of five days, starting on Christmas Eve.  ""Five days of Christmas"", is the paper's headline. The story continues on one of the inside pages - where the headline is: ""Just when you thought you didn't have to invite the in-laws"".   The Mirror reports that Sir Geoff Hurst has offered to donate his brain for dementia research after his death. The former England striker - who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 World Cup final - is campaigning for a ban on children heading footballs in a bid to stop them developing Alzheimer's. The paper says Sir Geoff believes players from his era have suffered from Alzheimer's because of regular heading in matches and training. Finally, there might be a chance to watch a live football match within weeks. The Express reports that officials have drawn up proposals for a phased return of supporters to sports venues when lockdown in England ends on 2 December.

Coronavirus: Oregon and New Mexico impose restrictions,"The US states of Oregon and New Mexico have announced strict measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 as the country faces growing outbreaks of the disease. Officials have ordered most non-essential businesses to close and urged people to limit their social interactions. On Friday, California became the second state to hit one million Covid cases, after Texas. On average, more than 900 people a day are dying with the disease in the US. Daily cases have topped 100,000 for the last 11 days and more than 67,000 people are currently in hospital. The US has seen over 10.7 million cases and 244,000 deaths thus far, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Trump administration struck an optimistic tone on Friday, saying they hope to have two vaccines and two therapeutic treatments for Covid-19 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks. Dr Moncef Slaoui, head of the administration's vaccine initiative, said 20 million doses could be ready to be distributed in December, and then at least 20 million doses each month after that. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he would not put the US into lockdown. ""Lockdowns cost lives and they cost a lot of problems. The cure cannot be.... worse than the problem itself and I've said it many times,"" he said. Data shows that the majority of the country has rising ""community spread"" of the virus - situations where people get the virus without any known contact with a sick person. In recent weeks, the Midwestern US has been the centre of the outbreaks, with cases rising in states like Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois.  Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced a two-week ""freeze"", limiting restaurants to take-out and shuttering gyms and recreational facilities from 18 November to 2 December. ""I'm not asking you, I am telling you, to stop your social gatherings ... and your house parties and to limit your social interactions to six and under, not more than one household,"" she said. Meanwhile, New Mexico Governor Lujan Grisham ordered a two-week shutdown of non-essential businesses such as grocery stores, farms, childcare centres, banks, factories and healthcare facilities. California and Texas - which reached the million-case milestone on 10 November - now both have viral caseloads that surpass other countries, including Mexico and Germany. The surges have prompted local officials to hit pause on reopening efforts in several states, and some are re-imposing stay-at-home directives. Eleven counties in California were told to reverse some reopening measures. Southern California is the worst hit part of the state, with substantial outbreaks. In Los Angeles, there are more than 330,000 infections. San Diego, Sacramento and Los Angeles counties are among the areas now on the lowest tier of California's reopening plan. Indoor dining and indoor religious services are prohibited. As the state's positivity rate - the percentage of positive tests in the population - is now at 3.6%, California Governor Gavin Newsom urged people to wear masks and distance, saying: ""Your actions could literally save lives."" President-elect Joe Biden also again renewed his call for Americans, ""regardless of where they live or who they voted for"" to ""step up and do their part"" with social distancing, mask wearing and hygiene. ""I understand it's not easy. I know people are tired. But this will not go on forever."" On Friday, it emerged that at least 30 Secret Service officers had contracted the virus in recent weeks, and dozens have been told to quarantine, the Washington Post and New York Times reported.  Many of the individuals had reportedly travelled to events around the US for both Mr Trump and Mr Biden. CBS News reports that 15 states saw the numbers of patients in hospital due to the virus double in the last month. Hospitals have warned that facilities could be overwhelmed if the trends continue. Colder weather has forced people indoors, and experts say pandemic fatigue is also making Americans less cautious. US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci told CBS on Friday: ""If we do the things that are simple public health measures, that soaring will level and start to come down.  ""You add that to the help of a vaccine, we can turn this around. It is not futile."" Outbreaks in the spring and summer followed US schools' spring breaks and the national Labor Day holiday weekend - and now experts are concerned that as Thanksgiving approaches at the end of the month, the spikes will again worsen. That is the situation playing out across the border in Canada, where people celebrated their Thanksgiving a month ago. The country's top doctors say that the holiday is partly why cities and provinces are now seeing record-high infections. Indoor gatherings pose a large risk to spreading the virus, and as the holiday centres around eating together, wearing masks is not feasible.  One analysis from Georgia Institute of Technology researchers found the risk of having a Covid-positive individual at even a 10-person sized gathering could be close to 100% in the worst-hit parts of the US. Back in October, Dr Fauci cautioned that the ""sacred"" American tradition of gathering together at Thanksgiving ""is a risk"". ""You may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering, unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected,"" Dr Fauci told CBS News.

Biden: 'More people may die' as Trump transition stalls,"US President-elect Joe Biden has warned that ""people may die"" if his incoming administration continues to be impeded by incumbent Donald Trump. Mr Biden said co-ordination was needed to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. He called President Trump's refusal to acknowledge he lost the election, despite calls to do so from both sides, ""totally irresponsible"". The Trump campaign launched a flurry of legal challenges in the wake of the 3 November vote to contest ballot counts. The president's team is trying to have courts overturn votes in key states on the grounds that many ballots were invalid or improperly counted. So far those efforts have failed and no evidence of significant fraud has emerged. President-elect Biden, a Democrat, has 306 votes in the electoral college, surpassing the 270 threshold needed to win. Yet Mr Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Monday: ""I won the Election!"" The government agency that launches transition process - the General Services Administration (GSA), headed by a Trump appointee - has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. This leaves them without access to sensitive government briefings that are normally provided to an incoming administration. Aides to the president-elect have said that Mr Trump's refusal to engage in a transition also means Mr Biden's team has been excluded from planning around a vaccination distribution strategy.   Speaking in his home state of Delaware on Monday, Mr Biden said of the stalled transition: ""Does anyone understand this? It's about saving lives, for real, this is not hyperbole.""  ""More people may die if we don't co-ordinate,"" he added.  Calling nationwide vaccine distribution a ""huge undertaking"", Mr Biden said that if his team had to wait until 20 January - his presidential inauguration - until they could begin work on the distribution programme, they would be behind by ""over a month, month and a half"".  Asked if he would encourage state leaders to reinstate stay-at-home orders, the president-elect sidestepped, and instead called on officials to encourage mask-wearing. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien spoke of a ""professional transition"" to the next administration on Monday. His tone was different from that of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who spoke of a ""second Trump administration"" last week, and others who act as though the president will remain.  When I asked Judd Deere, a spokesman here at the White House, about Mr O'Brien's remarks and his own role in the transition, Mr Deere shot the idea down: ""There's not a transition at this point."" When I asked about advice he'd give to those who will come after him, he got a bit testy: ""I don't speak in hypotheticals.""  His remarks reinforce those of the secretary of state, but clash with those of the national security adviser, an unsurprising development, given that their boss is himself a bundle of contradictions. He has tweeted about a Biden victory one moment and then reversed himself, and his cabinet secretary, adviser and others reflect his zig-zaggy approach. The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday said the Trump campaign would have to pay nearly $8m (Â£6m) for a vote recount in that state - which Mr Biden appears to have won by 20,000 ballots - if it still wanted one. But in a consolation for Mr Trump, Georgia officials said they had found nearly 2,600 ballots that had not been counted in a Republican-leaning county on election night. A voting official in the state, Gabriel Sterling, said the ballots were overlooked because of ""a person not executing their job properly"".  The isolated discovery was expected to improve Mr Trump's vote count by a net 800 - not by enough to overturn Mr Biden's lead of more than 14,000 ballots.  Georgia is conducting a statewide, by-hand recount because of the 0.3% margin separating the rivals. Meanwhile, the official overseeing the recount, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, told CNN on Monday that he had been coming under pressure from a fellow Republican, Trump ally and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, to disqualify legally posted ballots in certain counties.  Mr Graham denied the claim, telling Politico the two had merely had a ""very pleasant"" conversations about signature verification processes.",2020-11-17T07:38:22,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54967696,2020-11-17 09:51:50.989260,BBC,politics,0

Inventors design high-tech helmets for Covid protection,"By Stav DimitropoulosBusiness reporter For the past two months inventor Yezin Al-Qaysi has been riding the Toronto subway in Canada wearing a huge black ""mad helmet"". The hazmat (hazardous materials) helmet completely encloses his head and upper torso, and has a visor that extends all the way down to his chest. On the back is a battery-powered fan and filter respirator system that purifies air that is sucked in, and pushes ""stale"" air out. Looking like a dystopian figure straight out of an apocalyptic movie, the 32-year-old unsurprisingly gets some strong reactions. ""Somebody screamed: 'Where did you get that!' and many people approach me out of curiosity,"" he says. ""Others are amazed.. They certainly don't laugh, but even if they do, I cannot see their mouths because everyone is wearing masks."" Mr Al-Qaysi is one of a number of designers and entrepreneurs around the world who have rushed to release hazmat, or PAPR (powered air purifying respirator), helmets this year, aimed at people looking for more protection against coronavirus than just wearing a face mask. His is called the BioVYZR, and the battery is said to last for up to 12 hours. The Canadian says that his business - VZYR Technologies - now has sales in the ""tens of thousands"" mark. US Navy veteran Chris Ehlinger, is another hazmat helmet creator. ""These helmets in a sense psychologically prepare us for the future destiny of our species,"" says the 35-year-old. His company, Valhalla Medical Design, based in Austin, Texas, has launched a product called NE-1, which looks similar to a motorcycle helmet. In addition to a powered air filtration system, it has internal and external microphones and speakers, so that the wearer can more easily speak to people around him or her. It even has Bluetooth audio built in, so you can make a phone call or listen to music. But with a coronavirus vaccine having been announced last week, are helmets like these really necessary?  Michael Hall, whose firm sells a PAPR helmet called Air, believes they will be popular in the longer term with people concerned about bad air quality. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. His company, Utah-based Hall Labs, says it has sold 3,000 so far. It is also now working on more high-tech versions, where the visor turns into a screen on which the user can watch videos. ""And for airline travel we'll be able to create a segment [with helmets that work] like noise-cancelling headphones,"" says the 44-year-old. ""We think that there's a market for that kind of serenity."" Yet whether for protecting against airborne viruses or bad air quality, are such helmets a bit over-the-top? Natasha Duwin, whose Florida-based firm Octo Safety Devices makes face masks, says she can see the appeal. ""Helmets have the advantage that they show people's faces,"" she says. ""You can see smiles and human expressions, and have a very strong sense of security. ""Yet because each one of these helmets depends on at least two filtration systems, batteries, and [other things], all these items can break down. And if only one of them breaks down, you are in serious trouble."" She also cautions that the helmets will need to be thoroughly cleaned before each use. Ms Duwin says that for most people, all they need is a fitted, respirator mask that meets the certified quality standard in that country. Respirator masks have inbuilt filters, and both fit more tightly, and work more effectively, than simple fabric face masks. The above three helmets cost in the range of $149-$379 (Â£113-Â£288), but none has yet to receive certification. However, each of the three firms say they are nearing the final stages of the process. Dr Suzanne Pham, medical director of the Covid-19 response team at Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago, says: ""It remains to be seen if these fascinating helmets effectively battle Covid, as currently there is not enough research behind them. Dr Pham is also concerned that the helmets could lead to a societal division. ""It will create a split in society between those who can afford something that seemingly might protect them more, and those who cannot. ""And with those who cannot being left feeling like, 'Oh, am I being under-protected by wearing just a surgical mask?'"" However, she does think that the helmets will sell well, as much for the confidence they give the wearer as the actual protection they offer. ""After all, the pandemic has been first and foremost medical, but also psychological, absolutely.""",2020-11-16T00:03:26,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54916159,2020-11-16 08:10:07.524126,BBC,technology,0
Robots to take on more supermarket tasks,"By Ben MorrisTechnology of Business editor The next time you pack your bags at the supermarket checkout, give yourself a small pat on the back. A task which is so simple for humans - quickly and efficiently packing a bag of groceries of different sizes and shapes without crushing anything - is something that until recently has been beyond the abilities of robots. It requires vision systems to locate the produce, a flexible and strong hand to grab items and a sophisticated artificial intelligence which knows that a carton of eggs should not be stacked under a four-pint bottle of milk. It is a problem that James Matthews, the chief executive of Ocado Technology (part of the Ocado Group) is wrestling with in the warehouses that handle online orders. The company has a sophisticated warehouse in Erith in east London, which is already highly automated. Hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to a member of staff who will pack them into boxes, which are then loaded on to trucks for delivery. ""We're typically picking say 50 different items of different shapes and sizes, and how dense we pack them is absolutely critical to the economics of our business. ""If we put one thing per box on the road, then we're going to use a lot of vans very inefficiently.""  Ocado sell its system to supermarkets all over the world, but those customers are demanding ever greater efficiency, so training robots to pack the bags would make economic sense. The company had already been working with five robotic arms at the Erith warehouse, ""It's a very challenging space. It's not one where you can plot a very direct path to a solution there. Some of this stuff is still warm from academia,"" says Mr Matthews. But now the process is accelerating with two big acquisitions. Ocado is paying $262m (Â£198m) for Kindred Systems, a San Francisco-based firm that makes a robotic sorting systems.  In addition, it is buying Las Vegas-based Haddington Dynamics for $25m (Â£19m) which makes lighter-weight, and highly sensitive robotic arms. Kindred's sorting system is already used to pick products in clothing warehouses, including some owned by Gap. Mr Matthews thinks this tech can be adapted and developed for the grocery sector.  ""The two systems, we now intend to bring together. It will have some of our machine learning models that is very specific to grocery problems, and it will have some aspects of the Kindred platform that they've gone much deeper on."" In particular, Kindred is more advanced on tele-operation, or supervised autonomy, which is where humans monitor and control multiple robots remotely.  ""They [Kindred] can watch hundreds of these robots. And in the very small percentage, but critical moments, when the robot needs some help, they can provide that remote system very, very effectively."" So over the next year Ocado will be training the artificial intelligence used by Kindred, on grocery products.  The company hopes to have a robot that can replace human pickers within two or three years, but people will not be completely replaced. ""I think we are going to see an acceleration of the deployment of automation in the next three to five years. And so that's going to take a big bite out of those manual tasks. But I suspect in 10 years, there's still going to be a sizable portion of activities that are human led,"" says Mr Matthews. Mr Matthew is less forthcoming about the way Ocado plans to use technology from Haddington Dynamics, the maker of lightweight robotic arms, which can move very precisely. ""We've got some interesting, somewhat 'secret squirrel' use cases where lighter is a big play,"" he says. Mr Matthews is not giving much away, but says there is a limit to what a robotic arm can do if it just uses cameras to sense objects - imagine packing a bag if you could only use your eyes and not feel the products. Haddington's robotic arms are highly sensitive, so Ocado is researching how they might be integrated into the warehouse system. More Technology of Business There's little doubt that the demand for such technology is only going to grow.  Back in July the chief executive of Ocado Group, Tim Steiner said: ""The world as we know it has changed.  ""As a result of Covid-19, we have seen years of growth in the online grocery market condensed into a matter of months; and we won't be going back."" Analysts say that means supermarkets will have to upgrade their systems. ""I think that what the pandemic has showed is that the infrastructure that retailers had in place for moving in the e-commerce world, really failed spectacularly,"" says Miriam Burt, managing vice-president at the research firm Gartner. In particular she points to the so-called ""last mile"" - the picking, packing and delivery of groceries. ""It's very difficult to do last mile fulfilment profitably, partly because most of it is human labour,"" she says. So technology from the likes of Ocado will be in high demand. However, rivals like Norway's AutoStore and US-based Takeoff will also be looking to take market share. ""Companies everywhere will up their game - both those that will want to use Ocado and those that will want to compete with it,"" says James Lockyer, a technology analyst at Peel Hunt, in a recent research report. ""It doesn't surprise us that there is more noise from start-ups trying to take on Ocado at its own game, such as Takeoff. However, that does not take away from Ocado's chances of being the global leader."" In time, Mr Lockyer sees Ocado expanding beyond groceries. ""From vertical farming, to automation of fresh food delivery fulfilment, to the robotic meal prep of ready-to-eat meals, Ocado Group could actually end up revolutionising the entire supply chain.""",2020-11-13T00:11:33,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54902518,2020-11-13 14:35:52.722222,BBC,technology,0
Blakeney Nature Reserve: Record seal pup births predicted,"A nature reserve is expecting a record-breaking baby boom of 4,000 grey seal pups this winter, the National Trust has said. Blakeney Nature Reserve in Norfolk has become England's largest seal colony since recording its first pup in 1988. In 2019, 3,399 pups were born there, compared with 25 in 2001. The trust said the colony was thriving because of the lack of natural predators on the long shingle spit where the reserve sits. In previous years, rangers and volunteers and rangers would walk through the area and count the newcomers, but this technique is no longer safe for the animals or people. Teams will instead monitor the number of pups in a particular area, giving an indication of what is happening across the colony. National Trust ranger Leighton Newman said: ""When the seals first started pupping here it was really important to count the pups to help us monitor the health of the colony. ""More recently, however, the density of the colony has increased hugely and walking through the colony is now not safe."" Information from this year's count will be shared with the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University in Fife to help estimate how the mammals are breeding across the UK. The team at the reserve hopes it will be the start of ""more in-depth research"" into the colony which would provide ""a greater understanding of these curious creatures"".

I'm A Celebrity: Castle owner 'thought ITV email was spam',"A man who helped save the Welsh castle that will host I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! has said he initially took ITV's proposal for the series for spam. Mark Baker, who founded the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, said he originally ignored the broadcaster's email. But ITV got back in touch and the show is moving from Australia to Gwrych Castle in Abergele, Conwy, this year. It will host celebrities including Sir Mo Farah and Victoria Derbyshire. Mr Baker told the Radio Times: ""It mentioned a major proposal for a television programme, asking me to call urgently.  ""But in my job I get loads of strange emails from people claiming to be princes of Egypt with millions of pounds. ""I thought it was one of those, so I just left it."" Mr Baker said he had never seen I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! so is not sure how the new site will compare to the old one. He said: ""I know who Ant and Dec are, of course. I remember them from Byker Grove when I was a kid. ""That was the last time I saw them in anything. I don't watch much TV."" ITV's reported Â£300,000 fee has provided a valuable cash boost for the castle. Aged just 13, Mr Baker founded the preservation trust to raise awareness of the castle's history including direct links to the Royal family and housing Jewish refugee children during World War Two. The trust bought the derelict building in 2018 for Â£1 million, according to the Radio Times. Mr Baker hopes to fully restore it and open the castle up to the public.  He said phase one of the rebuild could cost Â£10 million and the fee from ITV would pay for just one part of the roof.",2020-11-10T09:08:34,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54885027,2020-11-14 11:15:15.575749,BBC,entertainment,0
"Vaccine rumours debunked: Microchips, 'altered DNA' and more","By Flora CarmichaelBBC Reality Check News of a vaccine which prevented 90% of people from getting Covid-19 in clinical trials led to a surge of anti-vaccine rumours on social media. We've looked into some of the most widely shared false claims: about alleged plots to put microchips into people, the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code, and about safety. Bill Gates was trending on Twitter this week following the vaccine announcement.  The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic.  He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development.  One of the most shared claims this week - one that has been circulating since early this year - is that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant tiny trackable microchips in people and that Mr Gates is behind it all. There is no evidence to support these claims and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has told the BBC they're entirely false.  Despite the lack of evidence, in May a YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans. A White House correspondent for a pro-Trump website, Newsmax, told her 264,000 followers on Twitter to ""beware"" the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Emerald Robinson claimed in the Tweet: ""It tampers with your DNA."" The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is another one we've seen aired regularly on Facebook posts. The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA. It appears the people spreading such claims have a fundamental misunderstanding of genetics. The vaccine contains a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or RNA. ""Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,"" said Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University.  Pfizer spokesperson Andrew Widger said the company's vaccine ""does not alter the DNA sequence of a human body. It only presents the body with the instructions to build immunity"". This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will alter DNA. We investigated a popular video spreading the theory back in May.  Part of the misunderstanding seems to stem from the type of vaccine being developed. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA, or ""mRNA"", technology.  It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus.  The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein.  Ms Robinson's tweet included the assertion that mRNA vaccine technology ""has never been tested or approved before"".  It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years.  Prof Almond says that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the first to show the efficacy that would be needed in order to be considered for licensing. Just because it's a new technology, he says, ""it doesn't mean we should be afraid of it"". New vaccines undergo rigorous safety checks before they can be recommended for widespread use. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose. In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues even after a vaccine is licensed. Claire Wardle, author of a recent report about vaccine myths on social media, says there is a ""data deficit"" around topics like mRNA technology - a situation where there is high demand for information, but credible information is in low supply. ""This leaves people vulnerable to misinformation, which rushes in to fill the gap,"" says Ms Wardle, executive director of anti-misinformation non-profit organisation First Draft. ""While credible information struggles to meet the demand, unreliable individual accounts and alternative news outlets are able to drive down confidence in vaccines,"" she says. Another claim in Ms Robinson's tweet was among the most widely shared anti-vaccine themes this week.   She claimed 75% of vaccine trial volunteers had experienced side-effects. But Pfizer and BioNTech have reported no serious safety concerns in their trial. Many vaccines do have side-effects. But the vast majority are not nearly as scary as anti-vaccine activists would have us believe. ""Like all vaccines, this vaccine can cause short-lived side-effects, including pain at the injection site, fever, muscle aches and pains, headache and fatigue,"" said Dr Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London.  Prof Ward pointed out that these kinds of side-effects are also experienced by a high number of people receiving the annual flu vaccination. The side-effects are usually mild, wear off after a couple of days at most, and can be alleviated with paracetamol or ibuprofen.  It's unclear where Ms Robinson gets the 75% figure from, but it may have selectively been chosen from the rate of mild side-effects reported in one age group in an earlier phase of the trial. Full data about side-effects has not yet been published for the most recent phase of the trial, but Pfizer has confirmed they observed no serious side-effects. The BBC contacted Emerald Robinson for comment, and she stood by her claims.

Tesco limits online customers amid Christmas rush,"Tesco has apologised to its online customers unable to get on its website as the supermarket seeks to cope with high demand for Christmas bookings. The UK's largest retailer has had to install a queuing system online to help it to manage the demand. Some customers complained to Tesco that they had been waiting hours to get onto the supermarket's website. ""We're sorry if things take a bit longer than usual,"" Tesco said on its Twitter account. ""A lot of customers are using our website and app at the moment."" Tesco said it was ""using a virtual waiting room to help us manage the flow"".  Supermarkets have been overwhelmed with demand as people start to plan for Christmas, and rival Ocado has already sold out of slots after ""huge"" demand. One Tesco customer said on Twitter: ""We use delivery saver because we have 3 young children and both parents work full time - I'm currently stuck in your queue while trying to get the children ready for school before I have to work full time to book my usual weekly slot. I've been staring at that screen for an hour!"" Tesco said that by late morning the waiting room had been removed and slots should be available again. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""Demand for online slots over the festive period is high, and we have more slots this Christmas than ever before.  ""We experienced high volumes of traffic to our website and groceries app this morning and temporarily limited the number of customers using it.  ""We've now removed the waiting room and customers will be able to log straight on. We're sorry for any inconvenience this caused and would like to reassure customers that there are still slots available for home delivery and Click+Collect over the Christmas period.""",2020-11-13T12:09:13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54894779,2020-11-13 14:50:18.149885,BBC,technology,0
Zuckerberg and Dorsey to be quizzed by Senate following Biden vote victory,"By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter If you follow US tech, you're probably getting a sense of deja vu. Senators are about to grill Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.  It's only three weeks since both chief executives testified. But since then the political landscape has wildly altered.  It is Democrat voices now, not Republicans, that arguably pose the greatest threat and will be listened to more closely.  In particular that of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee - though it's not confirmed whether she'll participate. After the election, there were fears that social media might fan the flames of chaos, and lead to riots on the streets. Although there were scuffles in Washington on Saturday night, mass unrest has not materialised. Collective sighs of relief have been heard around Silicon Valley. The world - so far - hasn't imploded.  But fake news and misinformation around the vote have been rife on both platforms.  Twitter and Facebook have labelled misleading content with varying degrees of success.  That has put them once again on a collision course with President Trump.  Howls of discontent from Republican voices greeted Twitter's repeated labelling of his tweets.  Many Republicans are now pushing for people to dump Twitter in exchange for Parler - a ""free speech"" version of the app.  But there's only so much you can do if Twitter decides to suppress, take down and/or label a tweet.  You can complain to Twitter or leave the platform, but ultimately Twitter decides what action to take. Twitter owns the platform. If you don't like the rules, too bad.  The same goes for Facebook.  That's why Republican senators see this as an opportunity to grill Zuckerberg and Dorsey - their first chance since the election - and to blow off some steam.  But the two CEOs will be aware it's Joe Biden they must now please.  Facebook, in particular, has already been the focus of anger from the President-elect's aides. Last week, one of Mr Biden's senior advisers attacked Facebook over its handling of conspiracy theories and calls to violence in the days following the US election. ""Our democracy is on the line. We need answers,"" tweeted Bill Russo, who is deputy press secretary to the US president-elect. Joe Biden has said previously that he would repeal Section 230 - the law that protects social media companies from being sued for the things people post.  In October, Democratic legislators penned a highly critical report into Big Tech. They called companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook ""monopolies"", and suggested they could be broken up.  So, this will be the first chance to gauge how the Democrats feel post-victory.  Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has a long history with Big Tech. As state Attorney General in California, she was seen in Silicon Valley as a straight shooter.  It will be interesting to see whether she decides to take this opportunity to put Zuckerberg under pressure.  Other Democratic senators may also see this as a chance to wave their credentials, and audition for cabinet. For example, Senator Amy Klobuchar has been tipped by some as Biden's pick for attorney general. She's already suggested that Google should be split up.  And Senator Chris Coons - also in the running for a top job - is one of several senators to put their name to a letter on Monday criticising the social network for its response to anti-Muslim content on the platform.  Get ready to hear a lot about how these two companies aren't doing enough to take down hate speech or fake news - with a special focus on Facebook. It's likely too that Republican Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz will ask fiery questions. But with two months left of a Republican administration, their words carry less of a threat than they did last month.  As power has shifted, so will Zuckerberg's and Dorsey's attention - this is their chance to convince the new rulers that light-touch regulation is best.

                         Note: The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Coronavirus cases have risen over the last few months in several regions of the world and the rate of infections is still increasing.  The most recent figures show there were more than 600,000 cases reported in 24 hours. Europe and North America are currently seeing the steepest rise in new cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the global death toll could hit two million before an effective vaccine is widely in use. Addressing the World Health Assembly this week, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""We might be tired of Covid-19. But it is not tired of us."" The US has recorded more than 10 million cases and is approaching 250,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world. Daily cases have been at record levels since early November as the number of infections continue to rise across the country.  President-elect Joe Biden has appealed to Americans to wear a mask as the best way to ""turn this pandemic around"".  Mr Biden has named a 12-person Covid-19 task force and has vowed to ""follow the science"" in dealing with the disease. The outbreak has had a devastating impact on the US economy, although there are now some signs it is recovering.  Nearly eight million Americans, many of them children and minorities, have fallen into poverty since May, according to researchers.  Cases and hospital admissions are now rising fast again in many European countries. Spain, France, Italy and the UK have all recorded more than one million cases, and several others are seeing their highest number of new infections since the start of the pandemic. Lockdowns and other restrictions have been reintroduced in some of the worst-affected regions, in an effort to control the latest surge in cases.  Both France and Spain have seen the daily number of cases start to fall in recent days. The pattern of rising infections following the loosening of spring lockdown restrictions is not limited to Europe, though. Japan has seen a second rise in cases since peaking in August, but the number of new deaths has remained relatively low. Other countries that have seen a resurgence of the virus include Turkey, Canada and Russia.  Several countries around the world are seeing cases spike at the moment.  In the Middle East, both Iran and Jordan have seen the number of daily infections rise sharply in recent weeks.  Jordan has increased security measures after thousands defied a five-day Covid lockdown, and protests were held against the results of parliamentary elections. In Latin America, Brazil has nearly six million confirmed cases, although the number of daily new infections has slowed. Argentina and Colombia have also recorded more than one million cases.  India has driven the increase in numbers in Asia, with nearly nine million confirmed infections, the second-highest official total in the world after the US.  Africa has recorded nearly two million cases, although the true extent of the pandemic there is not known as testing rates are low.  South Africa, with about 740,000 cases and 20,000 deaths, is still the worst affected country on the continent. Morocco, Egypt and Ethiopia are the only other African countries to officially record more than 100,000 cases. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020 and declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March. A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.  Governments across the world have been forced to limit public movement and close businesses and venues in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. This has had a devastating impact on the global economy.  Damage to the world's major economies is four times worse than the 2009 global financial crisis, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Meanwhile, the United Nations has said that up to 265 million people could face starvation by the end of the year because of the impact of Covid-19. The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.",2020-11-13T11:39:05,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105,2020-11-13 14:44:47.424494,BBC,world,0
US election 2020: Is Trump right about Dominion machines?,"By Christopher Giles and Jake HortonBBC Reality Check President Trump has criticised the use of an electronic voting system widely used by election authorities across the United States, saying it's lost him millions of votes. The machines targeted by Mr Trump were provided by Dominion Voting Systems, and the accusations range from the deletion of votes to inappropriate influence over the company by his political opponents. So what were his claims, and do they stand up? Verdict: There is no evidence to support this claim.  The president is referring to a news item on the pro-Trump, conservative news outlet One American News Network (OANN). ""Elections systems across the country are found to have deleted millions of votes cast for President Trump,"" it said.   The OANN report referred to an ""unaudited analysis of data"" obtained from an election monitoring group called Edison Research. However, the company's president, Larry Rosin, said: ""Edison Research has produced no such report and we have no evidence of any voter fraud."" OANN did not provide any evidence to back up its claim.  President Trump and his supporters have also been sharing a report from Fox News anchor Sean Hannity claiming Dominion voting machines flipped votes in key states from Trump to Biden. The report highlights problems in Antrim County, Michigan, where Dominion machines were used - suggesting there could be widespread software issues in other counties as well. There was an issue in Antrim County, but it wasn't the Dominion software that failed - it was down to a human error, as pointed out by Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. The Antrim County clerk at first failed to correctly configure the reporting function in the machine, so the initial results were incorrect, with Mr Biden winning by around 3,000 votes. Election officials noticed this unusual result in a typically Republican area, so they corrected the reporting function and re-ran the count - which showed President Trump winning by around 2,500 votes. Secretary of State Benson said the initial incorrect tally was quickly identified and corrected - and even if it wasn't, it would have been detected at a later stage in the checking process designed to identify such mistakes. She added: ""There is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state."" Mr Hannity also pointed towards potential problems in Georgia where the Dominion machines are widely used - but the Georgia Secretary of State said that despite some reporting delays, the software accurately counted and reported votes in the state. Dominion Voting Systems has released a statement saying: ""Claims about Dominion switching or deleting votes are 100% false."" Verdict: This is not correct - the company is not owned by the ""Radical Left"". It has made donations to both Republicans and Democrats in the past. It's not clear who Trump is referring to when he talks about ownership by the ""Radical Left"". He is probably referring to claims circulating online that the company has links to the Clinton family and other Democratic politicians, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  It is also important to clarify the difference between direct ownership of Dominion as claimed by Mr Trump, and donations made by the company either for philanthropic or lobbying purposes. Dominion has made donations to both Republican and Democratic interests, but it's not uncommon for a company such as this to lobby for government contracts in this way. Dominion Voting has released a statement saying it is a non-partisan US company and has no company ownership relationships with any member of the Pelosi family or the Clinton Global Initiative. The Clinton Foundation has also issued a statement saying it ""has never had any stake in Dominion Voting Systems; we have never been involved in the company's operations; and we can confirm that we are not currently working together"".  Dominion did however donate to the Clinton Foundation in 2014, and made a philanthropic commitment to the foundation to donate election technology to poorer countries. The company has also donated to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Senate Committee. The rumours about Ms Pelosi stem from her former chief of staff, Nadeam Elshami, being hired by Dominion - but it has also hired staff previously associated with the Republican party.  The accusations of involvement with Dominion have also extended to members of President-elect Biden's transition team.  Posts on social media claim Peter Neffenger, who is a volunteer for Mr Biden's team, is chairman of a subsidiary of Dominion, Smartmatic. Mr Neffenger is chairman of Smartmatic - but it's a competitor - not a subsidiary - of Dominion.   Verdict: It's true that Texas did not provide certification for the machines. Their approach is different to other states.  The US federal government provides guidelines for certifying voting machines - which is meant to produce a common standard across the country.  However, Texas has stipulated additional requirements, which the Dominion machines are unable to satisfy, such as that each ballot has a unique number so it can be traced.  ""If you forbid these unique numbers you create a stronger privacy guarantee for the voter.

Coronavirus: Do people still have to shield and what are the rules?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online During the first lockdown, certain people were advised to take extra steps - or shield - to avoid contracting Covid-19, because they were considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment.  As England enters a second lockdown, due to rising cases of coronavirus across the country, what are the recommendations? It's not the same as during the first lockdown, when the advice was to stay at home at all times, but clinically extremely vulnerable people are being advised to take extra precautions now. Infection levels in the community reduced over the summer, meaning the risk of exposure became significantly less than in the spring. This allowed some restrictions, including shielding, to be relaxed. But during the autumn, rates of new Covid cases have been rising again in most parts of the UK.  New government guidelines in England now strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or attend a medical appointment.   The advice says try to keep all contact with others to a minimum and avoid busy areas. If you go out, maintain strict social distancing, wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face. You should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within your household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate. The only people able to visit you at home are those in your support bubble - such as a relative or other person who helps with your care needs. You can go out and exercise with the people you live with or someone in your bubble.  You are also allowed to meet up outside with one person who is not in your household or bubble, but you should do so as safely as possible.  The advice says you should not leave the house to work during this lockdown period, which is set to be reviewed on 2 December. If you cannot work from home, you may be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit or the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Other people you live with who are not clinically extremely vulnerable themselves can still attend work if they cannot work from home. People on the shielding list are strong advised against visiting any shops, including pharmacies.  If you already have a priority delivery slot with a supermarket, that will continue - you do not need to do anything further. If you cannot access food or medicines, your local council can offer support.  An NHS Volunteer Responders service can help with collecting prescriptions and groceries.  Shielding was never compulsory and it is still your choice to decide what you are comfortable about doing. Everyone in England is expected to follow the lockdown rules. If possible, take things at your own pace and talk through any worries you have.  Scotland says people on the shielding list can follow the same advice as everyone else in their local area, guided by a tier system. Wales has introduced its own lockdown or firebreak restrictions and, again, people on the shielding list should follow the same rules as the rest of the population.  Shielding has been paused in Northern Ireland and people should follow the general regulations.  People in high risk categories, who include:  The list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing. Guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says that most youngsters with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and kidney disease do not need to continue to shield and could be removed from the shielding list held by the NHS. About 90,000 people shielding are under 18. Children will only be removed from the shielding list by their GP or specialist doctor after discussions with the child and their family. If you have been told that your child no longer needs to shield, they can go to school, college or nursery.  If a doctor has advised that your child should remain on the shielding list they are advised not to attend school during this lockdown.  Children who live with someone who is clinically vulnerable, but aren't themselves, should go to school.

Covid-19: Next two weeks 'crucial' for ending England lockdown,"The next two weeks will be ""absolutely crucial"" if England's lockdown is to end as planned on 2 December, a government scientific adviser has said. Prof Susan Michie said the public must resist breaking the rules in order to ""be in a position"" to spend the festive period with loved ones. News of a potential vaccine would make ""no difference"" to the current wave but could lead to complacency, she added.  The prime minister has said the current restrictions will ""expire"" next month. Prof Michie, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was too early to know what should replace the measures when they end, with the coming fortnight being key. She said: ""They're going to be a very challenging two weeks, partly because of the weather, partly because, I think, the promise of a vaccine may be making people feel complacent."" But she said data showed adherence to lockdown rules had been ""pretty steady since the summer"". Pubs, bars and restaurants as well as non-essential shops have been forced to close during the four-week lockdown in England. Boris Johnson has previously insisted the measures will end as scheduled but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said measures could last beyond 2 December. Prof Michie said people had to ""get their resolve together"" and resist any urge to break the rules, in order to maximise the chance of leaving lockdown. However, she said she was ""quite hopeful"" after tough measures in Wales and Northern Ireland brought transmission rates down. Wales finished its 17-day firebreak lockdown restrictions on Monday. Much of Northern Ireland's economy was placed under tight measures on 16 October.  Scotland introduced a four-tier system on 2 November after ending national curbs on the hospitality industry. Areas in the west of Scotland have been warned they may be placed under the highest level of restrictions next week. It comes after documents released by Sage on Friday, and dated 4 November, warned that a return to the tiered system of coronavirus restrictions in England after lockdown ends could see infections rise again. On Friday, Sage said that the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - for the UK had fallen to 1-1.2, with experts believing it is already below 1 in some places. A value below 1 means the number of infections is falling. Dame Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London, said the evidence suggested tier three restrictions had brought the R value down but it was not clear if they would get it under 1.  On Friday a further 376 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. As of 09:00 GMT on Friday, there had also been a further 27,301 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, compared to 33,470 on Thursday.

UK inflation rate rose to 0.7% in October,"The UK's inflation rate, which tracks the prices of goods and services, rose to 0.7% in October from 0.5% in September. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said a rise in clothing and food prices had pushed the rate higher.

Coronavirus: How are weddings working around the UK?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are currently banned in England during the second lockdown, which runs until 2 December. The only exception is where one of those getting married is seriously ill and not expected to recover. These weddings are limited to six people. Ceremonies can take place in the other UK nations, but with varying rules.  Weddings were banned when the national lockdown began on 23 March, affecting 73,600 weddings and civil partnership ceremonies. They are now allowed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  If you feel your day will be too different from what you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel.  Couples ''need to be understanding"" of current issues for venues and suppliers, says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. Many companies may have lost significant sums of money, so aim for a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published guidance on consumer weddings rights. It says:  While venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep part of your deposit, consumer rights law states they must give you a costs breakdown. If your wedding is technically allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. If your big day will now have to be ''radically different'' to what was agreed, you are entitled to the rights laid out above.  If it is a less significant change, then a proportionate price reduction would be appropriate - and you should not face ''disproportionately high charges'' if you still want to cancel. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act"", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding.  However, a few wedding insurers are paying out under some circumstances.  Many insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator, or - if you paid by credit card - claim up to Â£30,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card, you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to just hike up prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they were a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable.  The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust.",2020-11-11T15:55:53,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52811509,2020-11-13 14:43:29.821648,BBC,financial,0

Coronavirus: What is the R number and how is it calculated?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The reproduction number, or R value, for Covid-19 has fallen to its lowest point since early September - although it varies by region. The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 1.0 and 1.2. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread.  R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity.  That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others.  Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about 3 if no action was taken to stop it spreading.   You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.   Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.  If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card. But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one. The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops.  Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in the spring.  Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.  Scotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.1. In Wales the number is thought to be between 1.0 and 1.3 - while in Northern Ireland it is about 0.8. In England, the highest estimated R rate is in the South West and the South East, where it is between 1.2 and 1.4. The UK government said in the past that the R number was one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.  It then said estimates were less reliable and less useful because the number of cases was relatively low.  But when cases started to rise again, more attention was once again paid to local and national R rates. The aim will be to keep the R number below one. The R number is one of the big three. Another is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly.  The last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases. Having a vaccine is another way to bring down the reproduction number.  A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.

The loyalty oath keeping Rwandans abroad in check,"By Andrew HardingAfrica correspondent, BBC News Leaked footage of a controversial ""oath"" ceremony at the Rwandan High Commission in London has fuelled allegations of an aggressive global crackdown on dissent by the authoritarian government of the small East African nation, dubbed the new ""North Korea"" by its critics.  Members of the Rwandan diaspora have told the BBC that such ceremonies are commonplace and designed to instil fear and obedience.  One man said his relatives back in Rwanda had been abducted and possibly killed to punish him for refusing to co-operate. The Rwandan authorities have dismissed the allegations as false and unsubstantiated. In the video footage, recently circulated on WhatsApp, more than 30 individuals can be seen standing in a crowded conference room at the Rwandan embassy in the UK, raising their hands and pledging loyalty to the governing party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).  ""If I betray you or stray from the RPF's plans and intentions, I would be betraying all Rwandans and must be punished by hanging,"" the group says, in Kinyarwanda, while also promising to fight ""enemies of Rwanda, wherever they may be"". The RPF's use of an embassy - which in London is close to Marylebone Station - for an overtly political pledge is, in itself, noteworthy.  But, while some of those attending the ceremony - understood to have taken place in 2017 - may well have been genuine supporters of the governing party, now living abroad, others have told the BBC that many attendees were there under duress. ""I am certain the majority of people taking that oath did not believe it. We were lying to protect ourselves and our families back in Rwanda,"" said one person who was - according to our investigation - present at the ceremony, but who asked us not to reveal their name for fear of reprisals. ""This is what happens everywhere. It's routine. Either you take [the oath] or you are [the] enemy. It is black and white,"" said David Himbara, who was once a senior adviser to Rwanda's President Paul Kagame.  He is a Canadian citizen, academic and activist who says his life has repeatedly been threatened by Rwanda's security services. ""The vast majority go because they're terrified. They think that if they don't go, something will happen to their family [in Rwanda],"" said Rene Mugenzi, a British-Rwandan human rights activist, who was recently convicted of theft in the UK and jailed. ""You need to be active [in the RPF]. Even if you are neutralâ¦ they suspect you to be supporting opposition groups,"" he said. Asked about the ""oath"" ceremony, the Rwandan High Commission replied, by email, that members of the diaspora used its conference room for a variety of cultural engagements and that participation in an RPF loyalty pledge was legal and ""entirely of their own choice and no-one is forced to do so"". But the BBC has heard new evidence that Rwanda's government has not only sought to threaten members of the diaspora seen as disloyal, but also that it seeks to punish such people by targeting their relatives still living in Rwanda. ""In order to intimidate me, they abducted my two brothers. They were never involved in politics. They were on Rwanda soil. Why should they be paying such a heavy price for doing nothing?"" asked an emotional Noel Zihabamwe, from his home in Australia. Mr Zihabamwe is a prominent member of the Rwandan diaspora in Sydney, who came to the country as a refugee in 2006, seeking to escape what he saw as an increasingly stifling and repressive political climate.  He says his refusal to actively support the RPF government prompted a public death threat from a visiting Rwandan diplomat in late 2017, which he reported to the Australian authorities. That was followed by the alleged abduction of his two brothers, Jean Nsengimana and Antonine Zihabamwe, who were reportedly taken off a bus by police officers near the Rwandan town of Karangazi in September 2019 and have not been seen again. ""They often use this kind of kidnapping or murdering family members. This has to stop. We have had enough,"" Mr Zihabamwe said. ""We would like to see the Rwandan government restore democratic rights to all citizens, cease targeted killings, kidnappings, illegal arrests and campaigns of intimidation of former citizens, like me, who are living overseas,"" added Mr Zihabamwe, who now believes his brothers are probably dead and has decided to speak out in public, despite what he believes are considerable risks for himself and his extended family. ""Why can't they let the family know where their bodies are, so we can organise a formal funeral? There are many Rwandans outside who have lost or missed their beloved ones. ""I want to speak against injustice. We need leadership that can stand for everyone, not for some,"" he told the BBC. The Rwandan High Commission in London dismissed Mr Zihabamwe's allegations as ""tired and recycled"" falsehoods and a ""cheap ploy by political detractors to get free media attention"". But allegations such as these are considered credible by many researchers, human rights groups and foreign diplomats, who say the Rwandan authorities appear to have calculated that - despite provoking some criticism from Western governments - such actions, which have included several targeted assassinations abroad, never appear to result in any long-term damage to Rwanda's international relations.  The Rwandan government has received widespread global praise and financial support, over decades, for its hugely successful development agenda, which has helped to combat poverty and transformed Rwanda into one of the continent's most impressive economies. ""Their view is - we can do what we like, kill who we like,"" said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The case of the man, feted internationally - his story was turned into the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda - for sheltering people from the 1994 genocide, attracted global criticism earlier this year after he was spirited back to the country to face trial on terrorism charges. The death earlier this year, in police custody, of the popular gospel singer Kizito Mihigo also stirred huge anger.  Kizito, as he was popularly known, had tried to cross Rwanda's border illegally, the authorities said. They say he killed himself - a version which is widely disputed in the diaspora and by many analysts. ""If you're Rwandan, it's simply safer to stay silent,"" said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International's deputy director for East Africa. ""The Rwandan authorities have a whole toolbox of tactics that they use to supress dissent at home and abroad, ranging from harassment to threats to illegal detention, disappearances, torture, and even extending to returning Rwandan dissidents from other countries back to Rwanda without going through extradition proceedingsâ¦ and to threatening family members too."" The Rwandan High Commission in London said such allegations had no basis, and were being spread by a ""handful of opponentsâ¦ in order to damage the image and continued development journey of Rwanda"". President Kagame officially secured almost 99% of the vote in Rwanda's last presidential election in 2017.  In London, Abdulkarim Ali, an official in the opposition Rwandan National Congress, said: ""Either you pay allegiance to the RPF orâ¦ you become an enemy of the state. We normally compare it to North Korea."" In Canada, Mr Himbara described the Rwandan government's ideology as one of ""totalitarianism  - a government that wants to control all aspects of the Rwandan people, even in the diaspora"". The Rwandan High Commission in London said the government's main focus was to lift Rwandans out of poverty and create a good quality of life and opportunities for all of them. ""The focus of the High Commission is not on a handful of opponents who consistently spread false information in order to damage the image and continued development journey of Rwanda.""",2020-11-18T01:05:32,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-54801979,2020-11-18 08:23:52.461774,BBC,world,0
Fears grow for British man detained in Pakistan-administered Kashmir,"By Secunder KermaniBBC News, Islamabad There are growing concerns for the wellbeing of a British man facing up to three years in jail for taking down a Pakistani flag from a public square in Pakistani-administered Kashmir.  Tanveer Ahmed Rafique, a 48-year-old activist who has called for the disputed region to be granted independence from both Pakistan and India, was detained in August in the city of Dadyal. His wife told the BBC he has held a number of hunger strikes in protest at being denied bail and had become ""extremely weak"".  Fareezam Rajput said she believes Pakistan's intelligence agencies are pressuring the courts to continue to keep her husband in detention.  Police files show Mr Rafique has been accused of ""unauthorisedly removing the National Flag of Pakistan"". Officials in Pakistani-administered Kashmir insist the courts are free from interference and due process is being followed.   Responding to a letter from one of Mr Rafique's friends, who raised the case with him in his capacity as their local MP, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he shared concerns about the ""reported appalling treatment"" of Mr Rafique and promised to raise it with the UK Foreign Office.  Mr Rafique was born in Pakistani-administered Kashmir but moved to the UK as a young child. In 2005, he travelled back to Kashmir to spend time with his grandmother and eventually left his job in finance to settle permanently in the region. Control of Kashmir is split between Pakistan and India, which have fought a number of wars and smaller conflicts over the region. Both countries lay claim to Kashmir in its entirety. Mr Rafique, however, is part of a movement calling for a completely independent, united Kashmir. His wife told the BBC he was initially attracted to the cause after realising how difficult it was for his family in Pakistani-administered Kashmir to visit their relatives in Indian-administered Kashmir. ""He thought, this used be one state and it shouldn't be divided,"" she said. But Mr Rafique's peaceful activism attracted the attention of the authorities. Ms Rajput, his wife, told the BBC he had once previously been extrajudicially detained by the Pakistani military for three days before the British High Commission intervened. Mr Rafique's younger sister Asma, who lives in London, told the BBC her brother was warned by intelligence agents that if he did not stop his activities, ""nobody would ever hear of him or see him again"". The Pakistani military did not respond to a request to comment.  India-administered Kashmir has witnessed years of mass protests as well as a long running violent insurgency against Indian rule, with security forces accused of widespread human rights abuses. The dispute stems from the division of Pakistan and India in 1947. Tensions flared most recently when India revoked the special, more autonomous status of Kashmir last year.  Pakistani-administered Kashmir has not seen similar levels of unrest, and Pakistani officials frequently call for Kashmiris to be given the right of self-determination. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has described himself as a global ambassador for the Kashmiri cause, repeatedly demanding a plebiscite be held across Kashmir to decide its future in line with UN resolutions.  Mainstream political leaders, and many ordinary people in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, are supportive of the Pakistani state, which has been accused by India of backing separatist militants. However, voices in Pakistani-administered Kashmir calling for complete independence, as opposed to joining with Pakistan, have been deliberately stifled. The region's constitution forbids any activities deemed ""prejudicial or detrimental to, the ideology of the State's accession to Pakistan"". Ms Rajput told the BBC the detention of her husband shows the ""hypocrisy"" of Pakistan's position.  Raja Wasim, the press secretary to the prime minister of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, insisted laws preventing pro-independence activities were rarely actually enforced, however. As well as publishing a blog and videos online, Mr Rafique spent years conducting a survey of public opinion in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, canvassing, he said, the views of 10,000 inhabitants of the region. According to his findings, 73% of respondents identified primarily as Kashmiri rather than Pakistani.   A study by the international affairs think tank Chatham House in 2010 found that 44% of residents in Pakistani Administered Kashmir favoured independence, whilst 50% wanted to join Pakistan.  The results of Mr Rafique's survey were published in a local newspaper in 2017, but in a sign of how sensitive the issue is authorities ordered the newspaper to be shut down in response.  This August, Mr Rafique began a hunger strike in protest at the placing of Pakistan's national flag in the centre of the city of Dadyal in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. The region has its own flag and its own parliament, with a degree of autonomy. In a message sent from jail, seen by the BBC, Mr Rafique said he ""considered it my public duty to peacefully resist"" and take down the flag when officials failed to do so.  A fellow activist filmed Mr Rafique scaling the gate of a square that local residents have named in honour of a Kashmiri separatist leader who was executed by India in 1984. The video shows Mr Rafique removing a Pakistani flag, before being hauled away by police. The footage was picked up from social media by Indian TV channels, a development that was specifically mentioned in the case registered against him and which likely angered Pakistani officials. His wife, however, told the BBC Mr Rafique opposed both Pakistani and Indian policies in Kashmir.  In his message from jail, Mr Rafique described being ""punched"" and ""beaten with sticks"" during his arrest and subsequent interrogation. His wife alleged he had at times been kept in isolation in a cell normally reserved for those accused of crimes warranting the death penalty, until the British High Commission in Islamabad intervened. She said she believed his life was in danger as a result of his hunger strike.  Mr Rafique's family in Luton have been calling on the British Foreign Office to step up efforts to secure his release. His sister Asma Rafique told the BBC that while the British High Commission had been in contact with them, they felt ""disappointed"" with the level of support they had received and the slow pace of progress. ""I feel as is if everything is falling upon deaf ears,"" Ms Rafique said.  In a statement the UK Foreign Office said it was offering ""offering assistance to a British-Pakistani dual national"" and its staff were ""in regular contact with his family, his lawyer and the Pakistani authorities"". Ms Rafique said the ordeal had caused an ""immense level of stress"" for the family. ""I feel as if all our concerns are falling upon deaf ears,"" she said.",2020-11-13T00:08:36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54921606,2020-11-13 14:36:17.420034,BBC,world,0
Covid insurance test case heads to Supreme Court,"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent A hotly-contested case about insurance payouts for small businesses who were unable to trade owing to lockdown heads to the Supreme Court on Monday. A host of businesses closed or faced significant losses, so made claims on their business interruption insurance. But many insurers disputed the claims, arguing policies were never meant to cover such unprecedented restrictions. Supreme Court judges will make a final judgement after the hearing, which is expected to last four days. The issue will have had implications for 370,000 - mostly small - businesses, and involves potential payouts of Â£1.2bn. High Court judges earlier found mostly in favour of insurers having to pay out to policyholders regarding a selection of policy types. Some of these decisions are now being appealed against at the Supreme Court. Many thousands of businesses could not operate during the first national lockdown because, for example, they were unable to enter their premises. It meant some went out of business. Others - like Anna and Robin Smart's photography studio in Oxfordshire - had to downsize, make staff redundant, or relocate.  The Smarts moved their studio into their back garden and said the whole situation caused ""immense stress"". They, like others, looked to their insurer for compensation via their business interruption insurance policies. Some businesses paid premiums of many thousands of pounds a year for such cover. Some insurers refused to pay out, in some cases because they said disease clauses in contracts did not cover such a scenario. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, brought a test case with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. This went to the High Court, where judges found that most, but not all, of the policies involved should pay out offering a potential lifeline to many of these small businesses. But many have still had to wait while the proceedings were fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court. The High Court looked at 21 policy types as part of a test case, and rulings on 13 have been appealed against. These will be discussed in complex legal arguments over four days at the Supreme Court. Of these, the lower court said 11 should have led to payouts - decisions now being appealed against by insurers. Judges said two should not pay out, and these are the subject of appeal by the FCA. For two insurers, Zurich and Ecclesiastical, the judgement found entirely in their favour and the FCA decided not to appeal against the findings. The final ruling by the Supreme Court judges will provide authoritative guidance for the other policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. For example, the Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases.  The Supreme Court will give judgement some weeks after next week's hearing. The FCA will expect insurers to respond quickly to the final judgement, if the result means they are required to do so. Many businesses will have renewed annual policies since the first lockdown began and these will have Covid exclusions, so claims are mostly relevant for older policies during the first UK lockdown.",2020-11-16T00:01:26,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54931145,2020-11-16 08:07:44.222888,BBC,financial,0
Covid: Why is coronavirus such a threat?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent A simple virus has brought life as we know it to a screeching halt. We have faced viral threats before, including pandemics, yet the world does not shut down for every new infection or flu season.  So what is it about this coronavirus? What are the quirks of its biology that pose a unique threat to our bodies and our lives? In the early stages of an infection the virus is able to deceive the body.  Coronavirus can be running rampant in our lungs and airways and yet our immune system thinks everything is a-ok. ""This virus is brilliant, it allows you to have a viral factory in your nose and feel completely well,"" says Prof Paul Lehner from the University of Cambridge. Our body's cells start releasing chemicals - called interferons - once they are being hijacked by a virus and this is a warning signal to the rest of the body and the immune system.  But the coronavirus has an ""amazing capability"" of switching off this chemical warning, Prof Lehner says, ""it does it so well you don't even know you're ill"". He says when you look at infected cells in the laboratory you cannot tell they have been infected and yet tests show they are ""screaming with virus"" and this is just one of the ""joker cards"" the virus can play.  The amount of virus in our body begins to peak the day before we begin to get sick. But it takes at least a week before Covid progresses to the point where people need hospital treatment.  ""This is a really brilliant evolutionary tactic - you don't go to bed, you go out and have a good time,"" says Prof Lehner. So the virus is like a dangerous driver fleeing the scene - the virus has moved on to the next victim long before we either recover or die.  In stark terms, ""the virus doesn't care"" if you die, says Prof Lehner, ""this is a hit and run virus"". This is a massive contrast with the original Sars-coronavirus, back in 2002. It was most infectious days after people became ill, so they were easy to isolate. Remember the last pandemic? In 2009 there were huge fears about H1N1, aka swine flu.  However, it turned out to be no way near as deadly as anticipated because older people already had some protection. The new strain was similar enough to some that had been encountered in the past.  There are four other human coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms. Prof Tracy Hussell from the University of Manchester, said: ""This is a new one, so we don't think there's much prior immunity there."" The newness of Sars-CoV-2, to give it the official name, she says, can be ""quite a shock to your immune system"". This lack of prior-protection is comparable to when Europeans took smallpox with them to the New World, with deadly consequences. Building an immune defence from scratch is a real problem for older people, as their immune system is slow off the mark. Learning to fight a new infection involves a lot of trial and error from the immune system. But in older age we produce a less diverse pool of T-cells - a core component of the immune system - so it is harder to find ones that can defend against Coronavirus.  Covid starts off as a lung disease (even there it does strange and unusual things) and can affect the whole body.  Prof Mauro Giacca, from King's College London, says many aspects of Covid are ""unique"" to the disease, indeed ""it is different from any other common viral disease"". He says the virus does more than simply kill lung cells, it corrupts them too. Cells have been seen fusing together into massive and malfunctioning cells - called syncytia - that seem to stick around. And Prof Giacca says you can have ""complete regeneration"" of the lungs after severe flu, but ""this does not happen"" with Covid.  ""It is quite a peculiar infection,"" he said.  Blood clotting also goes strangely awry in Covid, with stories of doctors unable to get a line into a patient because it is immediately blocked with clotted blood. Clotting chemicals in the blood are ""200%, 300%, 400% higher"" than normal in some Covid patients, says Prof Beverly Hunt from King's College London. She told Inside Health: ""Quite honestly, in a very long career, I've never seen any group of patients with such sticky blood.""  These whole-body effects could be due to the cellular doorway the virus strolls through to infect our cells - called the ACE2 receptor. It is found throughout the body including in blood vessels, the liver and kidneys, as well as the lungs. The virus can cause runaway inflammation in some patients, making the immune system go into overdrive, with damaging consequences for the rest of the body.  Covid is worse if you are obese, as a generous waistline increases the risk of needing intensive care, or death. This is unusual.  ""Its very strong association with obesity is something we haven't seen with other viral infections. With other lung injuries, obese people often do better rather than worse,"" said Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge.  ""It looks pretty specific [to Covid] it probably happens in pandemic flu, but not regular flu."" Fat deposited throughout the body, in organs like the liver, causes a metabolic disturbance which seems to combine badly with coronavirus.  Obese patients are more likely to have higher levels of inflammation in the body and proteins that can lead to clotting.

Covid: Second lockdown 'will deepen sex work crisis',"By Clara BullockBBC West The second national lockdown is going to push sex workers ""even deeper into crisis"", according to a campaign group. The English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) has called for state support for workers in the coronavirus pandemic. It said people were having to choose between risking their health by working or seeing their family go hungry. Cari - not her real name - from the ECP said the new restrictions made it ""more urgent that the government provide the emergency payments we are demanding"". She said the government needed to address ""sex workers' illegal status that prevents women claiming the entitlements available to other workers"". About 80% of sex workers were single mothers operating in order to take care of their children, she estimated. Former sex worker Cari, from the Bristol area, said while a lot of women had stopped working because of safety concerns, some had continued as they did not have access to any financial aid.  ""Those who have to work are being very careful with clients. It is very, very difficult. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't,"" she said.  Rachel Mac Dermot, from Bristol's One25 charity, said: ""These women are the most marginalised, the most stereotyped, the most stigmatised. And I hate that.  ""They could be your mum, your sister, your daughter, your best friend.""  During the pandemic, the charity had to close down its women-only safe space but it has been providing food parcels to women who have been self-isolating. ""It's a bit different at the moment but before the pandemic we had a GP, a sexual health nurse and prescribing nurse visit each week,"" said Ms Mac Dermot.  ""Accessing support like healthcare, that you or I might take for granted, can be practically impossible for some women we meet.""  Cari said she hoped the government would legalise sex work and acknowledge what sex workers did counted as work.  ""Criminalising it makes it so much harder to come forward and access help. Sex workers currently can't even go to their GP's to get help, since it's illegal to do sex work during the pandemic,"" she said. ""But there are also no financial aids for sex workers, so how will this work? We have to decriminalise sex work. We have to."" A government spokesman said: ""We have no plans to change the law around prostitution and are committed to tackling the harm and exploitation associated with sex work. ""Universal Credit is providing a vital safety net to those who need support during the pandemic.""

Newspaper headlines: No 10's 'day of tantrums' as PM's team 'torn apart',"By BBC NewsStaff It is the end of the ""Cummings era,"" proclaims the Guardian, as the top aide leaves a ""void at the heart of No 10"". ""See ya!"" says the Daily Star. An official tells the Financial Times that Mr Cummings exit followed ""a day of tantrums."" The FT says Boris Johnson held a 45-minute meeting with him and director of communications Lee Cain to discuss ""their general behaviour."" The exchanges are described as ""tense"".  But Mr Cain tells the Daily Telegraph that the meeting was ""warm"" and Mr Cummings dismissed claims that he had briefed against the prime minister as an ""invention"". The Times suggests the pair were told to leave ""with immediate effect"" because of fears ""they would poison the well"" if they stayed. Senior figures tell the Times that there is likely to be a huge clear out of aides appointed by Mr Cummings and Mr Cain. They predict that ministers will reassert their authority.  Meanwhile, speculation has begun about who may now become the permanent chief of staff. Sajid Javid is touted by the Telegraph and the Times, although sources close to the former chancellor play down the suggestion.  The Sun raises concerns about the government's future direction, and insists the Prime Minister must not pursue what it calls a more ""woke"" ""Labour-lite"" agenda. The Daily Mail asks ""is the family Christmas at risk?"" with government scientists warning that there is little-to-no scope to loosen social distancing rules when the lockdown ends in England.  The Times takes a different view, concluding that the experts are backing a lifting of the lockdown, and ending Tier one - medium - restrictions, judging them to be pointless.  Campaigners tell the Daily Mail the pledge by Health Secretary Matt Hancock to ring-fence a supply of coronavirus swabs for family visitors to care homes is insufficient. Care home bosses are demanding an immediate rollout of rapid tests to all sites.

Freight volume is already up because of Brexit. Retailers warn it could lead to product shortages this Christmas. The Daily Mirror reports the comedian Eddie Izzard wants to become a Labour MP. His suggestion has been welcomed by the former deputy leader Tom Watson who says he has the ""passion that can change the world"". The death of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, is marked by most of the papers. The Sun and Daily Mail both offer pullouts on the murderer.  The Daily Mirror and Yorkshire Post focus solely on his victims and print photos of all 13 women. The Post says thoughts should be saved for their relatives, acquaintances and friends whose life sentences go on. There is a suggestion in The Times that train fares could go up by more than 1% above the rate of inflation next year.  But the paper says rail bosses fear a big rise could drive more passengers off the trains amid sweeping changes to working patterns amid the pandemic. And the Times suggests headphones may be on their way out. Instead, bubbles of sound could be beamed into the the area next to the ear.  Sensors would track the person's position and emit ultrasonic waves in pockets of energy nearby.

Vincent Reffet: French 'Jetman' dies in training accident,"A French stuntman famous for airborne feats using jetpacks and carbon-fibre wing packs has been killed in a training accident in Dubai.  Vincent Reffet was part of the company Jetman Dubai. The 36-year-old went viral for flights over the Gulf city's waterfront waterfront and the Alps. A statement said Reffet died ""during training in Dubai"" but did not give any further details. An investigation into the death is now under way. ""Vince was a talented athlete, and a much-loved and respected member of our team,"" the statement said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those who knew and worked with him."" Reffet was the child of skydivers and had performed numerous stunts throughout his career, including BASE-jumping off the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.  He became well known for his flights with Jetman Dubai, created by the Swiss pilot Yves Rossy - himself known as ""Jetman"". Rossy's equipment allows the group's pilots to fly at speeds of up to 250mph (402km/h). ""Everything we do is something new,"" Reffet told AFP news agency in an interview last month. ""We have so many dreams and life is so short."" Reffet's exploits often went viral on social media, including one occasion when he jumped from a mountain into a moving plane with colleague and fellow Frenchman Fred Fugen.

Covid: How Marcus Rashford campaign changed free school meals,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News The government in England has reversed its decision not to offer free school meals in the Christmas holidays, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. More than a million people signed a petition he set up. A Â£170m winter grant distributed by local authorities will help provide support for food and bills to poor families from early December. When schools closed in the first coronavirus lockdown, families whose children qualify for free meals were provided with food vouchers. The government said this would not carry on during the summer holidays. However, they backed down after a campaign involving Mr Rashford, who relied on free school meals in his childhood. The footballer then called for the voucher scheme to be extended until Easter 2021. The idea was rejected by MPs, with the government saying it had already increased universal credit and provided Â£63m to local authorities to help people facing hardship. The government now says it will give local authorities Â£170m to provide food in the Christmas holidays, while schools will continue to provide the meals in term time. The grant will also be spent on helping hard-hit families with their bills. The government also promised: Governments in Scotland and Wales have said they will extend their schemes until Easter 2021. The Northern Ireland Executive has not yet made its plans clear. Free school meals have been at least partially funded by the government for more than a century, because of concerns about malnourishment and children being too hungry to concentrate during lessons.  Children of all ages - from nursery to sixth form - may be eligible if they live in households receiving income-related benefits, including:  Eligibility varies slightly between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland because the nations set their own rules. New claims made in England must come from households earning a maximum income of Â£7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. It's the same in Scotland and Wales, but in Northern Ireland the household income threshold is Â£14,000. In England and Scotland, all infant state school pupils (those in Reception and in Years 1 and 2) can get free school meals during term time. If a child qualifies for school meals, they remain eligible until they finish the phase of school they're in as of 31 March 2022, whether primary or secondary. In England, about 1.4 million children claimed for free school meals in January 2020 - 17.3% of state-educated pupils.  The take-up was greatest in the north-east of England (23.5%), followed by the West Midlands (20.5%) and the north-west of England (20.2%). Analysis by the Food Foundation estimates a further 900,000 children in England may have sought free school meals since the start of the pandemic.  Most children were not at school during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. This prompted concerns that those eligible for free school meals could ""fall through the cracks"" and go hungry. In recent years, free school meals have been linked to lowering obesity levels, and boosting academic achievement for poorer pupils. During term time, the government in England expected schools to support pupils eligible for free school meals through alternative schemes, including: Many families were issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. It also ran throughout the Easter and May half-term holidays. In June, Mr Rashford first called for the scheme in England to be extended over the summer holidays. As someone who received free school meals as a child, he said ""the system isn't built for families like mine to succeed"". In response to his initial campaign, the government in England set up a Â£120m ""Covid summer food fund"" for children on free school meals, which cost about Â£20m for every week of the school holiday. Following the winter funding announcement, the footballer voiced concern for the families who would still miss out on help. But he said the steps taken ""will improve the lives of near 1.7 million children in the UK over the next 12 months, and that can only be celebrated"".",2020-11-09T13:44:04,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53053337,2020-11-13 14:47:42.954694,BBC,politics,0
"Children in Need: Kylie, Cher and KSI cover Oasis for charity","A star-studded line-up of singers covering Oasis track Stop Crying Your Heart Out is among the highlights for this year's Children In Need. The BBC's annual charity appeal show, which is turning 40, will be hosted live in a London studio on Friday evening by Mel Giedroyc, Alex Scott, Chris Ramsey and Stephen Mangan. They will come together to help raise money for disadvantaged UK children.   Ahead of the show, Joe Wicks completed his 24-hour workout challenge. The fitness guru raised more than Â£1m with his efforts, which culminated on Friday morning. Last year's event raised an ""on the night"" total of Â£47.9m. Putting in a similarly epic fundraising shift will be former One Show host Matt Baker, who returns for the Rickshaw Challenge. The charity version of Stop Crying Your Heart Out, which was originally released in 2002, also features Bryan Adams, Nile Rodgers, Gregory Porter, Lenny Kravitz, Paloma Faith, Robbie Williams, Ava Max and Jess Glynne. It got its first airing on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show on Radio 2. ""Children in Need is such a special charity and so loved by everyone, including me,"" said Australian pop star Kylie. ""It was a privilege to take part in this recording with so many amazing artists."" ""This year it feels even more poignant than ever, and I hope we can all come together to raise as much as possible"" she added. This year sees the return of presenter Giedroyc, who joked that Children in Need ""is now older than me, I can't believe it!"" ""It is an absolute honour for me to join the rest of the gang hosting a heart-warming, fabulous, surprising and entertaining show - it's going to be blooming brilliant and a dazzingly delightful night of top telly!"" added the Mel and Sue star, and former Bake Off host. TV presenter Emma Willis, meanwhile, will narrate Life in Lockdown - a film showing youngsters living through difficult circumstances during the coronavirus pandemic. The feature follows research commissioned by the charity, which found that 94% of children and young people have had cause to feel worried, sad or anxious in the last six months. ""The current pandemic has affected all of our lives, but some families have additional and complex needs and challenges outside of Covid-19,"" said Willis. ""Being part of this documentary, I was able to see just how vital BBC Children in Need's funds are to families across the UK in times of crisis ""People are facing incredibly challenging times, but I hope the public tune in and donate if they can to a much-needed cause."" There will also be appearances by the 2020 Strictly Come Dancing cast, Beverley Knight, and Shawn Mendes; as well as the cast of West End musical Six.  Comedy sketches will come courtesy of the stars of King Gary and The Goes Wrong Show. Children in Need is on BBC One on Friday at 19:00 GMT. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronaut crew primed for 'routine' flight,"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent Nasa and its private launch services provider SpaceX are getting ready to send four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew will ride to orbit in a Dragon capsule atop a Falcon-9 rocket. It will be only the second time that this launch system has been used to transport people.  It follows a successful demo flight conducted back in May, which marked the resumption of astronaut missions from US soil after a gap of nine years. The Falcon-Dragon combo is due to depart the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 19:27 local time (00:27 GMT, Monday). It's an ""instantaneous launch window"", meaning the mission must leave on the button if it wants to catch the station as it circles the Earth overhead. Much depends on the weather, of course. Unacceptable winds on the space coast have already forced one 24-hour delay. Should there be a further postponement for any reason, the next attempt would be made on Wednesday. The crew comprises three US space agency (Nasa) astronauts - Commander Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker - and the highly experienced Japanese space agency (Jaxa) astronaut Soichi Noguchi. They've named their Dragon ship ""Resilience"". The group will spend roughly six months on the station, raising its complement to seven.  Nasa's Kate Rubins and the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov are already aboard the 410km-high platform. Having a seven-strong team on the ISS will triple the amount of microgravity science that can be conducted on the platform. Victor Glover will become the first African-American astronaut to undertake a long-duration mission on the station. In the 20 years that humans have permanently occupied the orbiting facility, black astronauts have only ever visited for short periods. Nasa says this launch signifies that it has moved fully into the new era in which it purchases crew transport services from private contractors, rather than owning and operating its own vehicles, as was the case with the now retired space shuttles. SpaceX is in charge on launch day, albeit with Nasa looking over its shoulder. It is the company's people that will be running the show from Kennedy's ""firing room"" and from the SpaceX in-flight operations centre in Hawthorne, California.  It's also SpaceX staff that conduct the close-out activities at the pad, strapping the Nasa crew into the Dragon's seats and closing the hatch. Everyone involved in the launch got the chance to practise their roles on Thursday during a dress rehearsal. This saw the astronauts put on their white spacesuits and go through the steps they'll take for real on Sunday. Controllers are watching the weather closely. Even if conditions in Florida look favourable, they also need to be acceptable all along the flight track to orbit. If something goes wrong during the ascent and the Dragon capsule needs to abort the mission and come back to Earth for an emergency splashdown, it will want to avoid high winds and choppy seas. Controllers are therefore monitoring the weather at some 50 points along a path that stretches up the eastern seaboard of the US and across the Atlantic to the west coast of Ireland.  But it's not just for a capsule return that this is important. SpaceX wants to fly back and recover the Falcon's first-stage so it can be used again. This involves landing the booster on a drone ship and this becomes more challenging the bigger the wave heights. SpaceX has signed contracts with Nasa valued in excess of $3bn to develop, test and fly an astronaut taxi service. As part of this relationship, the company ran a demonstration mission in May in which astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were taken to the station and then returned safely to Earth.  The contracted arrangements also call for six ""operational"", or routine, missions - this flight being the first. Nasa has a similar deal with the Boeing aerospace company, although its service is a good year behind SpaceX. The agency says its new model of contracting out transportation to low-Earth orbit has saved it billions of dollars in procurement costs. It intends to use these economies to fund its Moon and Mars ambitions.  Nasa is close to testing the giant new rocket it has commissioned to take astronauts back to the lunar surface, a goal it hopes to attain in 2024.",2020-11-15T13:08:02,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54938444,2020-11-15 16:12:42.068298,BBC,technology,0
Is the Covid vaccine safe for me? And other questions,"A coronavirus vaccine thought to protect 90% of people may be available in the coming months.  Here are some of your questions about the vaccine, and other related topics.  The NHS has been planning how best to roll out the vaccine once one becomes available. It will be a large-scale immunisation programme, requiring lots of trained staff to administer the jabs.  Pharmacists, nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals will be able to vaccinate people in a range of settings â including care homes, hospitals and GP clinics as well as pop-up centres, such as sports stadiums and conference buildings.  It could mean some delays to some non-Covid NHS services, but urgent and essential care will be prioritised. The aim is to keep usual services running whenever possible. You could contact your GP to discuss any concerns you have. If your immune system is suppressed, certain ""live"" vaccines are not recommended.  Thatâs because these vaccines contain a live but weakened version of the virus which could potentially replicate too much and cause problems if the immune system is not working as well as it might. Most of the vaccines available in the UK, including the flu jab, do not contain live virus and are fine to give, even if someone is on immuno-suppressant drugs. The Covid vaccines being developed are not live vaccines either. If a coronavirus vaccine is approved for widespread use, it is likely that people will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. Thatâs because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.  More studies and data are needed before any of the many coronavirus vaccines in development can be approved.  The Pfizer trial only included volunteers who had not caught Covid before, so the results do not provide information on vaccinating people with prior exposure to the pandemic virus. A vaccine will only be approved for use if regulators are satisfied that it is safe. Should a vaccine become available, it is not clear whether pregnant women would be offered it. There is no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to get seriously ill from coronavirus but they are included in the ""clinically vulnerable"" list as a precaution.  Some vaccines, such as the flu jab, are recommended during pregnancy. Scientists around the world have been working at record speed to find a vaccine that can protect people against Covid-19. Although the research is being fast-tracked, safety is paramount.  No vaccine will be approved unless regulators are satisfied that it is safe as well as effective. Clinical trials involving thousands of volunteers are used to check this.  Even after a vaccine is approved, safety is continuously monitored. Any treatment can have some side effects in some people â vaccines are no different. Scientists and medics assess the possible risks against benefits of any treatment or intervention. The exact priority list of people who will be eligible for a coronavirus vaccine has not been finalised, but when it is, it will be individuals who are considered, rather than couples. However, on a published interim list of priority groups, age is the main factor when deciding in which order people would be vaccinated. It is too soon to tell if any of the coronavirus vaccines that are currently being developed will be able to stop people from spreading the virus to others.  Some might reduce the severity of disease, rather than prevent infection. No. It will be optional and offered first to those who could benefit the most, such as the elderly and healthcare workers.  Englandâs Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed: âWe are not proposing to make this compulsory â not least because I think the vast majority of people are going to want to have it.â  If it becomes available, children will not routinely be offered it, because they are low risk. Some countries require proof of vaccination for other diseases - for example, for polio. It will be up to individual countries to decide their own vaccination policy for Covid and whether an immunisation certificate is necessary in the future for travellers. There was also a suggestion when Prime Minister Boris Johnson talked about his ""Moonshot"" plan for mass rapid testing, that a negative on-the-day result would allow people to go to the theatre or a football match. If regulators agree that the vaccine is safe and effective, then doctors, nurses and pharmacists can start giving it to people.  Those with the greatest clinical need will be offered it first, as long as it has been shown that the vaccine works well enough in this high-risk group. Age is the biggest risk factor for severe Covid, which is why older people will be put at the front of the queue for a vaccine. The UKâs independent advisory committee on immunisation â the JCVI â has drafted a provisional priority list.
                        At the top are elderly people living in care homes, along with the staff who look after them. Next are people aged 80 and over, along with other health and social care workers. People over 65 or with underlying health conditions will then follow.  The ranking then moves down the age brackets to eventually include everyone over the age of 50 as more stock becomes available. The priority list could change if Covid vaccine trial findings show particular jabs are more effective for certain groups or populations. The ingredients in the vaccine are not very stable and need to be kept at below minus 70 degrees Celsius until before use.  That means it must be transported carefully. But it must be thawed before it is given to a patient and Pfizer says the jab remains viable for up to five days kept in a normal fridge before it is administered. Experts have recently discovered mutations in the genetic code of coronavirus that appear to have happened when mink caught the disease from humans and then passed it back to people.   Scientists are studying these alterations to see if they have significantly changed the behaviour and threat of the virus to mankind. So far, there is no evidence that the mutations pose an increased danger to people or that they will undermine the effectiveness of any Covid-19 vaccines.  All viruses mutate to some extent over time. Some changes can make a virus less lethal or contagious. Flu â a different virus to Covid â changes frequently, which is why the annual flu vaccine changes too, to keep pace.  Drug company Pfizer has announced preliminary results from its ongoing vaccine trial. Experts need to wait to see the full results to know exactly who the vaccine will protect best and whether it could stop people spreading the infection even if they do not have symptoms. The interim findings from the Pfizer trial suggest 90% or nine in every 10 people who get the vaccine will have protection against catching and getting symptomatic coronavirus seven days after a second dose of the jab (with the first dose given three weeks before the second one). The finding is based on tests in 43,500 people â half who received the real jab and the other half who received a dummy or placebo vaccine containing only salt water.  During the trial, 94 of the 43,500 volunteers developed Covid symptoms and tested positive for the virus. Almost all of these were people who received the placebo vaccine. It is likely that people will need booster or repeat immunisations against Covid-19.  Experts are unsure how long immunity might last against the virus â they suspect it will wane over months, meaning a Covid vaccine could become an annual event, a bit like the flu shot. Unfortunately, visits are discouraged if you live at university.  The regulations say you must not move back and forward between your permanent home and student home during term time. Students should only return home at the end of term, and further guidance will soon be published on how this can happen safely.  However, many people have voiced concerns about studentsâ mental health. Student Minds, a student mental health charity has set up Student Space to offer support, online and over the phone. Yes, you are. There is nothing in the new regulations that would prevent people returning home â the restrictions apply to holidays, returning to your home country is permitted.  Entry to Australia is currently closed to most people. However, Australian citizens and permanent residents, and their immediate family members, are allowed to travel to the country.On arrival, all international travellers must spend 14 days in quarantine at a designated facility, for instance at a hotel, at their port of arrival.  This will be arranged by the state or territory in which travellers arrive. You may have to pay a fee for your quarantine.You may also have to undergo enhanced health screening before entering quarantine. The Australian government has travel advice for Australians wanting to go back home to the country.  While you are allowed to stay away from home overnight for work purposes, you can only do this in another household's home if you have formed a support bubble with them. So if you are not already in a support bubble with someone else, then you can form a bubble with your colleague in order to stay in their home. Otherwise you would have to stay in guest accommodation such as a hotel. The new English lockdown restrictions will not prevent you doing either of these things. You are allowed to travel for work, if you cannot work from home, and you are allowed to travel to your local supermarket. Wales is currently under a âfirebreakâ lockdown until 9 November, and during this period, travel into Wales is limited to essential journeys only. However, this includes travelling for work and to acquire necessities such as food, so you are allowed to cross the border for both these purposes. Travel in and out of Wales will still be restricted after the firebreak ends, but you should still be able to travel for work and to buy food. If this is your job, you are allowed to carry on. Where it is necessary to work in other peopleâs homes - for example, for nannies, cleaners or tradespeople - you can do so, as long as the owners are happy for you to come into their house and you follow the guidance for working safely. If the garden can be accessed without going into the house, even better.  However, people over 70 and those with underlying health conditions are classed as vulnerable and advised to minimise contact with others, so itâs important to check they would be happy for you to come.   If you are looking after their garden on a voluntary basis, then the guidance is less clear. You can continue to provide support as a carer, but gardening may not not qualify as part of that role.  Yes. Any one person can meet any other one person in a public outdoor space for the purpose of exercise and recreation. There is no limit to how many different people you can meet on successive days - or even on the same day. However, you cannot meet people in a private garden, unless you live with them or have formed a support bubble with them. Children under five, as well as disabled people dependent on round-the-clock care, are not counted towards the limit on two people meeting outside. Up to a point.  The government says you should avoid travelling in or out of your local area, and you should look to reduce the number of journeys you make. But it says you may âtravel to exercise, if you need to make a short journey to do soâ. It says that you are encouraged to walk or cycle where possible, and to try to avoid busy times and routes on public transport. Yes. Informal childcare bubbles can carry on during the lockdown period.  Grandparents can still look after their grandchildren as long as they are aged 13 or under.  However, all people aged over 70 are considered to be âclinically vulnerableâ, whether or not they have any underlying health conditions, and are advised to take extra precautions in terms of washing their hands and thoroughly cleaning frequently touched areas. Unless you have already formed a household support bubble with your son, you will not be able to stay overnight in his house during the lockdown period. Overnight stays away from your primary residence are not allowed unless they are for work or education, or for other specific circumstances such as moving house or attending a funeral. If you are not already in a support bubble with your son, and you are not working on the house in a professional capacity, you will not be able to continue helping him during this period if you both need to be inside the house. Yes, you should be able to attend your appointment.  Opticians and other businesses providing medical services, including dentists, are allowed to remain open during the lockdown.  However, it would be worth reconfirming the details with your optician in case they have made any changes to appointments which may affect you.  As with any shop, you should wear a mask while you are inside the premises and should maintain social distancing from staff wherever possible. Yes, you are allowed to leave home to look for a property to buy or to rent, and that includes viewing residential properties. The rules permit any activity in connection with the purchase, sale, letting or rental of a residential property, such as visiting estate or letting agents, viewing show homes, preparing a property for a move and, ultimately, moving house. People outside your household or support bubble should not help with moving house unless it is absolutely necessary, and you should wear a mask and maintain social distancing wherever possible.  It depends on a number of factors, but it should be allowed if it is not at someone's home. The latest government guidance for England states that it's permitted to leave one's house for a funeral, and ""to attend a commemorative event celebrating the life of a person who has died"".   A maximum of 30 people are allowed to attend a funeral, while a maximum of 15 are allowed at a linked ceremonial event (this also includes stone settings and ash scatterings). The wake must not be held in a ""private dwelling"", and whoever is organising or managing the event must take required precautions regarding social distancing and hygiene.  Yes - unlike the first lockdown. The government's guidance states that âa number of public services will also stay open and you will be able to leave home to visit themâ. It has been confirmed by the Chief Dental Officer for England that this includes dentists. 
                        Practices are expected to continue operating under the restrictions which have been in place since they began to reopen during the summer.  Yes you can. During Englandâs temporary lockdown, you can only meet with one other person from outside your household or bubble, and then only at an outdoor public place such as a beach, park, public garden, allotment, playground or in the countryside. But children under school age are not counted in the total. So meeting your friend for a walk with your baby is fine. But you should not meet indoors or in a private garden. Unfortunately not. Group exercise classes are not permitted in any setting during the lockdown, with indoor and outdoor leisure facilities such as gyms and dance studios told to close. Community halls will still be able to host support groups and childcare. You can exercise in an outdoor public place with one person from outside your household or bubble if you remain socially distanced. This could be a jog or bike ride, or a one-to-one pilates session. Yes. All non-essential shops will have to close under the new regulations. However, the government says that retailers who deliver to customers or offer click-and-collect services may stay open to do this. According to the government rules for England, due to come in to force at 00:01 GMT on Thursday, you can still travel to work ""if your job involves working in other peopleâs homesâ. There is, as yet, no specific government guidance, but the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has tweeted that âtradespeople will be able to enter homesâ as long as they follow social distancing rules. However, you may not work in the home of anyone who is self-isolating because of coronavirus. In addition, the government is advising people over the age of 60, and anyone with conditions or illnesses that make them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, to minimise their contact with other people. Support bubbles are still in place during the new lockdown. Anyone who lives alone can join up with one other household, which can be of any number of people. It's advised that you form a bubble with someone who lives nearby to avoid unnecessary travel. Bubbles can also be formed with another household if a single adult lives with children who were under the age of 18 on 12 June 2020. And if someone shares custody of their child or children with someone they do not live with, they can have a bubble with the child's other parent in addition to their chosen support bubble.  So, as long as your neighbour lives alone or with children under 18 and is not already in a bubble, other than for shared custody purposes, the answer is yes. Hotels, and other types of guest accommodation, are only going to be open for people who have to travel for work purposes.  There are going to be a ""limited number of other exemptions"" set in law, the government has said.  Also, if you were planning a holiday rather than a business trip, you should bear in mind that the new rules state ""you should avoid all non-essential travel by private or public transport"". The government has said that certain businesses will have to close during the lockdown, with only those offering what are deemed essential services staying open.  Those having to shut include what it called ""personal care facilities"", which are places like hairdressers and barbers, beauty and nail salons and spas. That was also the case during the first lockdown earlier this year.  In addition, mixing of households indoors is only allowed for very limited purposes - like childcare or providing other care - which would mean a mobile hairdresser could not visit your home. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has said that people will still be able to move house, whether they are renting or buying. Removal firms and estate agents can also carry on working but must follow Covid safety guidance. Places of worship will not be open for normal services.  They will however stay open for funerals, individual prayer, for broadcasts of acts of worship, formal childcare, voluntary and public services like blood donation or food banks, or for some support groups. All indoor and outdoor leisure facilities - including gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools - will have to shut.  People are being encouraged to exercise outside during the lockdown, in places such as local parks.  Mortgage payment holidays are being extended for homeowners financially affected by the pandemic.  Borrowers who have not yet had a mortgage holiday can request from their lender a pause in repayments, and that can last up to six months.  Those who have had their payments deferred already can extend their mortgage holiday until they reach the six-month limit. If you can't download the new NHS Covid-19 tracing app, it is probably because your phone runs on an older operating system. The app will only work on a certain number of newer models.  This is because it uses technology only recently developed by Apple and Google, which will not work on earlier operating systems.  Your phone must have the IOS 13.5 operating system installed (released in May 2020), or Android 6.0 (released in 2015), as well as Bluetooth 4.0 or higher.  This excludes the iPhone 6 or any earlier models, as well as old versions of Appleâs handsets (and some newer Huawei phones). If your smartphone is not compatible, the NHS Test and Trace Service is still the first port of call for any contact tracing issues.  Apple and Google's framework will not allow two apps to contact trace simultaneously.  So when you cross the border from England to Scotland, you need to open the Scottish app and turn on contact tracing within it. This will bring up a prompt asking: ""Switch app for exposure notifications?"" When you do this, it will turn off the app you were using beforehand. You can get your own unique QR code at this government website. All you need to enter is your email and your restaurant's address.  Every business, place of worship, event and community organisation with a public space should create a unique QR code they can display for visitors to scan. You can then print off a QR code poster. Itâs a good idea to put the QR poster near the entrance, so that visitors can log their location by scanning the poster with the track and trace app when they arrive. If you run more than one venue, you will need to create a separate QR code for each location. The government says that the app âhas been designed to work in the phoneâs background, working alongside other Bluetooth features and devicesâ, so your hearing aids should be unaffected. If you do find some interference, there is an online form to report this to them. There have been no reports of interference between the app and medical devices in trials, but the government says it is sensible to be cautious when you rely on a medical device â in particular, it has included advice for people who use pacemakers. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia.  Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. Hong Kong scientists have reported the first case of a man who was reinfected with coronavirus, although the World Health Organization has warned against jumping to conclusions on the basis of one case. University of Oxfordâs Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it âprobably is likelyâ that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. Scientists have said that the âincubation periodâ - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home.  For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health can take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many ""silent spreaders"" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many ""silent carriers"" there may be.  Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk. However, some may be advised to take extra precautions if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures.  Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldnât be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. Many of the experimental coronavirus jabs currently being tested contain the genetic instructions for the surface spike protein that coronavirus uses to attach to and infect human cells. Reassuringly, scientists have not seen any substantial mutations to this part of the virus yet that would render these vaccines useless. If youâre living with someone whoâs self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway.  ""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. ""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus."" If the purpose of your visit is to provide care for your mother, you can still visit her. Although Wales is about to enter a two-week âcircuit breakerâ lockdown (from 23 October to 9 November) which will put a stop to all but essential travel in and out of the country, government guidance says that you are still allowed to âprovide care for or to help someone who needs it, such as an older personâ¦ even if they are not part of your householdâ. You can also visit someone on compassionate grounds if necessary. There is a travel ban already in place which bars entry to areas of Wales under lockdown (such as Denbighshire) from areas of England classed as high risk (such as West Cheshire). However, travel between these areas is still allowed if it is for essential reasons - such as providing care. Yes. People in your childcare bubble can continue to provide childcare in private homes and gardens. A childcare bubble is where someone in one household provides informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare to a child aged 13 or under in another household. Childcare can also continue to be provided at home by registered childcare providers, including nannies, and people in your support bubble. It depends in which Tier area you live.  If your household is in a tier one area, you can have up to six people in your house, observing social distancing with those who donât live with you. But if you are in a tier two or 3 area, you cannot mix with another household indoors, although in tier two, others can be with you in your garden. However, if your in-laws are over 70, or under 70 âwith a specified, underlying health conditionâ, then they are allowed to visit you, as âproviding care or assistance to someone vulnerableâ counts as an exception to the general meeting up rules.   Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The governmentâs chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that ""infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in generalâ. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals.  It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education arenât usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they canât work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth Â£95.85 per week, as long as they qualify.  However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If youâre worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you donât have to go into quarantine if youâre returning to the UK from whatâs known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the ""Dublin dodge"") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Key workers will not necessarily be exempt.  The government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules. Among others, it includes road haulage and freight workers, medical and care professionals providing essential health care, some seasonal agricultural workers, Eurostar and Eurotunnel employees, pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways. It also depends where you are going in the UK - some employees will be exempt from quarantine in England and Wales, but not Scotland.  The government guidance details what youâll need to show when you enter the UK to prove you are exempt. This differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work youâll be doing. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you.  However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas.  You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them.  Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands.  Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. If you and your boyfriend both live alone and in England, you can form a support bubble, which means that you can spend as much as time as you want in each otherâs company, inside or outside a house. You donât have to keep a 2m distance from one another, and you can stay overnight at each otherâs house. If you are living alone, and your partner is in a shared household (or vice versa), matters get complicated. You can still form a support bubble with your boyfriend but it will also be with his household, and it would be the only bubble allowed to that household. What this means is that if one of your boyfriendâs housemates has a partner who is - like you - living elsewhere and alone, that couple will be prevented from meeting up. Support bubbles are for the benefit of people who are living alone (or alone with children). If both you and your boyfriend are living in shared households, you are not allowed to form one and you are restricted to meeting outdoors and at a distance of 2m from each other. Northern Ireland has also introduced support bubbles while Scotland and Wales now allow a similar arrangement known as ""extended households"". In all of these, if one person taking part develops symptoms, every member of the bubble or extended household must self-isolate. If you're in England, and you're a single grandparent, you have the right to form a âsupport bubbleâ with your grandson and his family.  Under the governmentâs guidance, your grandson is able to stay at your home, including overnight, and would not need to keep a 2m distance.  However, the complicating factor here is your lodger. Are you maintaining a 2m distance from each other, and are you using separate rooms and facilities? If the answer is yes, then there should be no problem. On the other hand, if you have been using the same kitchen, living room and bathroom, and eating from the same crockery and cutlery as your lodger, then you are both effectively part of the same household, and you do not qualify to be part of a support bubble. People who have a serious heart condition are more vulnerable to coronavirus. Many children with heart conditions will, until recently, have been shielding to protect themselves. Experts are now looking into whether as many children will need to shield in the future, given the reduced level of risk posed to children. Across the UK, children who have been shielding are expected to return to school.  However, if a child has an extremely serious condition, your doctor can advice otherwise and parents should engage with the childâs school about the best way to continue their studies. If there is an increase in cases in an area and a local lockdown is enforced, it is important to check what that means for children with health conditions who are allowed to return to school.  The question of whether pupils and teachers should be tested for Covid remains a matter of debate among politicians and scientists.  In a report for the Royal Societyâs Delve initiative, scientific researchers called for regular testing of teachers and secondary school pupils, whether or not they were showing symptoms of the virus.  The childrenâs commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has also called for weekly tests for staff and pupils.  However, other scientists have questioned whether regular testing would have much point in areas where infection rates are low. The schools minister Nick Gibb has said the government has no plans for general testing in schools: âThe advice that we have is that itâs better to test when people actually show symptoms.â Schools have been issued guidance on how to ensure face coverings are removed safely.  Pupils are to be instructed by staff not to touch the front of their face covering during use or when removing it.  They are also encouraged to wash or sanitise their hands after removing masks. If pupils have disposable masks, they should put them in a covered bin or if they have reusable masks they should be stored in a plastic bag until they are reused.

Buying a baby on Nairobi's black market,"Babies are being stolen to order in Kenya to feed a thriving black market. Africa Eye infiltrated the trafficking rings selling children for as little as Â£300. By Peter Murimi, Joel Gunter, and Tom Watson. Somewhere, Rebecca's son is 10. He could be in Nairobi, where she lives, or he could be somewhere else. He could, she knows in her heart, be dead. The last time she saw him, Lawrence Josiah, her firstborn son, he was one. She was 16. It was about 2am one night in March 2011 and Rebecca was drowsy from sniffing a handkerchief doused in jet fuel â a cheap high on the city's streets. She sniffed jet fuel because it gave her the confidence to go up to strangers and beg. By the time she was 15, Rebecca's mother could no longer support her or pay her school fees, and she dropped out and slid into life on the street. She met an older man who promised to marry her but instead made her pregnant and left. The following year Lawrence Josiah was born, and Rebecca raised him for a year and a few months until she closed her eyes that night and never saw him again. ""Even though I have other kids, he was my firstborn, he made me a mother,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""I have searched in every children's centre, in Kiambu, Kayole, and I have never found him."" Rebecca still lives on the same streets in Nairobi. She is small, with sharp cheekbones and short, tightly braided hair. She has three more children now â girls aged eight, six, and four. The youngest girl was grabbed once, she said, by a man who'd been hanging around the area, and claimed the barely one-year-old girl had asked him to buy her a drink. Rebecca followed him to a car afterwards, she said, where a woman was waiting. The next day, he was back. You do not have to look hard to find similar stories around the streets where Rebecca lives, alongside other unhoused Nairobi residents. Esther's three-year-old son disappeared in August 2018. ""I have never been at peace since I lost my child,"" she said. ""I have searched for him all the way to Mombasa."" It's been five years since Carol's two-year-old son was snatched in the middle of the night. ""I loved him so much,"" she said. ""I would forgive them if they would just give me back my child."" Vulnerable women are being preyed on in Nairobi to feed a thriving black market for babies. Over the course of a year-long investigation, Africa Eye has found evidence of children being snatched from homeless mothers and sold for massive profits. We uncovered illegal child trafficking in street clinics and babies being stolen to order at a major government-run hospital. And in an effort to expose those abusing government positions, we arranged to purchase an abandoned child from a hospital official, who used legitimate paperwork to take custody of a two-week old boy before selling him directly to us. The baby-stealers range from vulnerable opportunists to organised criminals â often both elements working together. Among the opportunists are women like Anita, a heavy drinker and drug user who herself lives on and off the street, and makes money stealing children from women like Rebecca â targeting mothers with infants under the age of three. Africa Eye found out about Anita through a friend of hers, who wanted to remain anonymous. The friend, who asked to be called Emma, said Anita had different methods for snatching children on the street. ""Sometimes she will speak to the mother first, to try and see if the mother knows what she plans to do,"" Emma said. ""Sometimes she will drug the mother, give her sleeping pills or glue. Sometimes she will play with the kid.  ""Anita has a lot of ways to get kids."" Posing as potential buyers, Africa Eye set up a meeting with Anita in a pub in downtown Nairobi frequented by street sellers. Anita told us she was under pressure from her boss to steal more children, and she described a recent abduction. ""The mother was new to the streets, she seemed to be confused, not aware of what was going on,"" she said. ""She trusted me with her child. Now I have the child."" Anita said her boss was a local businesswoman who bought stolen babies from petty criminals and sold them for a profit. Some of the customers were ""women who are barren, so for them this is a kind of adoption,"" she said, but ""some use them for sacrifices"". ""Yes, they are used for sacrifices. These children just disappear from the streets and they are never seen again."" That dark hint echoed something Emma had already told us, that Anita said some buyers ""take the kids for rituals"". In reality, once Anita has sold a child on, she knows little about their fate. She sells them to the businesswoman for 50,000 shillings for a girl or 80,000 shillings for a boy, she said â Â£350 or Â£550. That is roughly the going rate in Nairobi to steal a child from a woman on the street. ""The businesswoman, she never says the business she does with the kids,"" Emma said. ""I asked Anita does she know what the woman does with them, and she told me she could not care less whether she takes them to witchcraft or whatever. As long as she has money, she does not ask."" Soon after the first meeting, Anita called to arrange another. When we arrived, she was sitting with a baby girl who she said was five months old and she had just snatched moments before, after winning the mother's trust. ""She gave it to me for a second and I ran away with it,"" she said. Anita said she had a buyer lined up to purchase the girl for 50,000 shillings. Emma, our source, attempted to intervene, saying she had been introduced to a buyer who could pay 80,000. ""That is good,"" Anita said. ""Let's seal the deal up for tomorrow."" A meeting was set for 5pm. Because a child's life was in danger, Africa Eye informed the police, who set up a sting operation to arrest Anita and rescue the child, once our buyer had met her. It was likely to be the last opportunity to secure this baby girl before she disappeared. But Anita never showed up, and despite trying for days we were unable to find her. Weeks later, Emma finally tracked her down. She told us Anita said she had found a higher bidder and used the money to build a two-room, tin-sheet house in one of the city's slums. The child was gone. The police still have an open file on Anita. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in Kenya â no government reports, no comprehensive national surveys. The agencies responsible for finding missing children and tracking the black market are under-resourced and under-staffed. One of the few safeguards for mothers whose children are taken is Missing Child Kenya, an NGO founded and run by Maryana Munyendo. In its four years in operation, the organisation has worked on about 600 cases, Munyendo said. ""This is a very big issue in Kenya but it is under-reported. At Missing Child Kenya we have barely scratched the surface."" The issue had ""not been prioritised in action response plans for social welfare,"" she said. That is partly because this is a crime whose victims tend to be vulnerable, voiceless women like Rebecca, who do not have the resources or social capital to draw media attention or drive action from the authorities. ""The under-reporting has a strong correlation to the economic status of the victims,"" Munyendo said. ""They lack the resources, networks and information to be able go somewhere and say, 'Hey, can someone follow up on my missing child?'"" The driving force behind the black market is a persistent cultural stigma around infertility. ""Infertility is not a good thing for a woman in an African marriage,"" Munyendo said. ""You are expected to have a child and it should be a boy. If you can't, you might get kicked out of your home. So what do you do? You steal a child."" A woman in that situation will most likely be put in touch with a trafficker like Anita's boss, who uses vulnerable people like Anita to snatch children on the street. Or they might be connected to someone with access to a hospital. According to Africa Eye's research, child-trafficking rings are operating within the walls of some of Nairobi's biggest government-run hospitals. Through a source, we approached Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital. It is Leparan's job to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable children born at Mama Lucy. But our source said Leparan was directly involved in trafficking. The source arranged to meet Leparan, and told him he knew of a woman desperate to purchase a child after failing to conceive. ""I have this baby boy in the hospital,"" Leparan replied. ""They dropped him off two weeks ago and never came back."" According to our source, this was not the first time Leparan had arranged to sell a child. ""The last case scared me,"" Leparan said in the meeting, which Africa Eye recorded. ""Suppose we do this, I want a plan that won't cause us problems later on,"" he said. Children like the abandoned baby boy on offer from Leparan should be taken to a government children's home while they are placed officially with foster parents who have been subject to background and welfare checks. When they are sold illegally by people like Fred Leparan, nobody really knows where they will end up. Posing as a woman called Rose, an undercover reporter working for Africa Eye met Leparan at an office close to the hospital. Leparan asked a few cursory questions about Rose's status. She said she was married but could not conceive, and was under pressure from her husband's family to give birth. ""Have you tried adoption?"" Leparan asked. ""We thought about it but it seems like it is a bit complicated,"" Rose replied. With that, Leparan agreed. The price would be 300,000 shillings â Â£2,000. ""If we go ahead with this deal it will only be the three of us - me, you and him,"" he said, pointing to Rose and our source. ""My issue is trusting someone. It is very risky. It worries me a lot."" He said he would be in touch to arrange the sale. Between the street snatchers like Anita and the corrupt officials like Leparan, there is another layer to Nairobi's child-trafficking business. Dotted around some of the city's slums you can find illegal street clinics with delivery rooms for expectant mothers. These makeshift clinics are a known location for the black-market trade in babies. Working with a local journalist, Judith Kanaitha of Ghetto Radio, Africa Eye approached a clinic in Nairobi's Kayole neighbourhood, home to thousands of the city's poorest residents. According to Kanaitha, the baby trade is booming in Kayole. The clinic we approached is operated by a woman known as Mary Auma, who said she had worked as a nurse in some of Nairobi's biggest hospitals. Kanaitha posed as a buyer. Inside the clinic, two women were already in labour. ""This one, she is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she is almost ready to deliver,"" Auma said, whispering. She offered to sell the unborn child to Kanaitha for 45,000 shillings â Â£315. Auma did not appear concerned for the mother's welfare after the birth. ""As soon as she gets her money, she will go,"" she said, waving her hand. ""We make it clear, they never come back."" The woman in the clinic that day whose unborn baby Auma was negotiating for sale was Adama. Adama was broke. Like Rebecca, she had been abandoned by the man who got her pregnant, and the pregnancy had cost her her job on a construction site when she could no longer carry heavy bags of cement. For three months, her landlord gave her grace, then he kicked her out and boarded the place up. So Adama decided to sell her baby. Mary Auma was not offering her the 45,000 shillings she was attempting to charge us. She told Adama the deal was for just 10,000 â Â£70. ""Her place was dirty, she would use a small container for blood, she had no basin, and the bed was not clean,"" Adama said later, in an interview in her village. ""But I was desperate and I didn't have a choice."" Adama said that the day we walked into the clinic, Mary Auma had just induced her, without warning, by giving her tablets to swallow. Auma had a buyer and was keen to make a sale. But the birth was not smooth. The baby boy had chest issues and Auma told Adama to take him to Mama Lucy hospital for treatment. After two weeks, Adama was discharged with the baby. She texted Auma, and Auma texted us. ""New package has been born,"" she wrote. ""45,000k."" At the clinic, Adama was reunited with Auma and her assistant. ""They said the baby looked OK and if the client wanted him he would be taken straightaway,"" she said. Adama had made a painful choice to sell her child. Now she was reconsidering. ""I did not want to sell my baby to someone who would not be able to take care of him, or someone who buys babies to go use them for other things,"" she said later. So Adama left the clinic that day carrying her baby boy. She dropped him instead at the government-run children's hospital, where he would wait for foster parents and, she hoped, a better life. She never got the money she needed. She lives alone now, away from Nairobi, and sometimes she dreams about her son and wakes in the early hours and thinks about him. Sometimes, if she can't get back to sleep, she walks down the road in the dark until she finds someone else awake. But she doesn't regret her choice. ""I feel at peace to have given my baby to the government,"" she said, ""because I know he is safe."" Fred Leparan, the clinical social worker at the government hospital, called to say he had identified a baby boy given up by his mother that he wanted to steal for us. The boy was one of three children at the hospital waiting to be transferred to a nearby children's home. It was Leparan's job to ensure they got there safely. But Leparan knew that once the babies left Mama Lucy hospital, there was only a slim chance anyone from there would check they had arrived at the home. At the hospital, Leparan filled out the necessary paperwork and made small talk with the staff, who had no idea that a child was being stolen on their watch. Rose, the undercover reporter, was waiting in a car outside. Leparan told the hospital nurses she worked for the children's home and asked them to take the babies out to her. He seemed increasingly anxious, but he assured our source that the nurses would not follow them. ""No, they can't, they have work to do,"" he said. Then he urged the team to leave quickly. ""If we keep chatting like this someone may suspect,"" he said. Moments later, the team drove out of Mama Lucy hospital with three infant children in the car and instructions to deliver just two of them to the children's home. From there, the third baby could have gone anywhere, to anyone. The undercover team delivered all three children safely to the home, where they will be cared for until a legitimate adoption can be arranged. Later that afternoon, Leparan called Rose to a meeting and instructed her to place the agreed 300,000 shillings on the table. He instructed her to see a nutritionist. ""The only thing to keep an eye on is the boy's vaccine mark,"" he said. ""Also, be careful. Be very careful."" The BBC confronted Fred Leparan about this transaction but he refused to comment. The hospital also declined requests to comment, and Leparan appears to have kept his job. We also informed a children's rights NGO about Mary Auma's illegal street clinic in Kayole, which in turn informed the police. But Auma appears to still be in business. She did not respond when we put our allegations to her. And we attempted to put our allegations to Anita, but she seemed to have once again disappeared into the shadows of the street. For the mothers whose children were stolen, there will never be any real resolution. Most go on in limbo, hoping to see their child again, knowing that they probably won't. Rebecca would give ""everything"" to see her son, she said. ""And if he died I would like to know too."" Last year, she heard that someone saw a boy in a distant neighbourhood of Nairobi that looked just like her eldest daughter, Lawrence Josiah's sister. Rebecca knew it was probably nothing, and she had no way of getting to the neighbourhood and no idea where to look if she did. She did get as far as the local police station, but she couldn't get any help, she said, and eventually she gave up. ""There is a one in a million chance these women will see their children again,"" said Maryana Munyendo, from Missing Child Kenya. ""Many of the street mothers are children themselves, and they are taken advantage of in their vulnerability."" People like Rebecca were too often not seen as sympathetic victims of crime, Munyendo said. ""But nobody should assume that people on the street do not have feelings, that they do not deserve justice. They do have feelings. The way you miss your child if you live in a suburban area is the same way you miss your child if you are a mother on the street."" Some of the babies stolen from the street will end up in those suburban areas. Sometimes Rebecca thinks about the wealthier women who paid for them â about what it takes to raise a child you know was stolen from someone else.  ""What are they thinking?"" she said. ""How do they feel?"" Photographs by Brian Inganga",2020-11-15T23:58:34,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-54892564,2020-11-18 08:27:34.802500,BBC,politics,0
"Covid-19: Normal life back next winter, says vaccine creator","The impact of a new Covid vaccine will kick in significantly over summer and life should be back to normal by next winter, one of its creators has said. Prof Ugur Sahin, BioNTech co-founder, also raised hopes the jab could halve transmission of the virus, resulting in a ""dramatic reduction in cases"". Last week, BioNTech and co-developers Pfizer said preliminary analysis showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. About 43,000 people took part in tests. In an interview on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Prof Sahin said he expected further analysis to show the vaccine would reduce transmission between people as well as stop symptoms developing in someone who has had the vaccine. ""I'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine - maybe not 90% but maybe 50% - but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread,"" he said. The UK is expected to get 10 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. The jab, which was trialled in six countries, is given in two doses, three weeks apart. Older residents and staff in care homes are likely to be prioritised, followed by health workers and the over-80s. People would then be ranked by age. After the announcement of the world's first effective vaccine came on Monday, Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, suggested life could be back to normal by spring. ""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" he said. However, Prof Sahin said it would take longer. If everything continued to go well, he said, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the ""end of this year, beginning of next year"".  He said the goal was to deliver more than 300 million doses worldwide by next April, which ""could allow us to only start to make an impact"".  He said the bigger impact would happen later, adding: ""Summer will help us because the infection rate will go down in the summer and what is absolutely essential is that we get a high vaccination rate until or before autumn/winter next year."" Prof Sahin said it was essential that all immunisation programmes were completed before next autumn. The vaccine has given a boost of confidence that an end to the pandemic is close, with the leading scientist behind it hopeful life could return to normal by next winter.  But there are some big uncertainties.  The vaccine needs approval from regulators - and they will only grant that if they're happy the jab is safe and works well. Early results look very good, but we await the full ones in the coming weeks.  There is also no data yet to show how well the jab works in those who need it the most - the elderly.  Nor do we know if it stops people spreading the disease, as well as getting sick.  And it's not clear how long immunity might last. People might need yearly boosters.  If the vaccine is rolled out, it will take time to immunise and protect enough people. Other Covid-19 vaccines may come along that work just as well or even better than this new vaccine.  But it is possible that by the summer, mass immunisation will be well under way and we could start to reap the benefits.  Asked if the vaccine was as effective in older people as it is in younger people, he said he expected to have a better idea in the next three weeks. He said it was not yet known how long immunity would last after the second dose of the vaccine is given. However, he said, a booster immunisation ""should not be too complicated"" if it was found immunity was reduced significantly after one year. Prof Sahin also said the ""key side effects"" of the vaccine seen so far were a mild to moderate pain in the injection site for a few days, while some participants had a mild to moderate fever over a similar period. ""We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study,"" he added. His vaccine is one of 11 currently in the final stages of testing.  It will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The agency's head has said it would not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a vaccine quickly. If it was approved, the NHS would be ready to roll out the vaccine from December, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people not to slacken their resolve in the meantime, saying the vaccine's development ""cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go"". Meanwhile, concerns have been raised that mutated forms of the virus might hamper the effectiveness of future vaccines. It comes after 12 people were found with a mink-related strain of the virus following an outbreak in Denmark. Virology professor Wendy Barclay, a scientific adviser for the government, said there was a ""worry"" that the vaccines currently under development ""won't work quite so well as the virus continues to evolve"". This did not mean vaccines would not work at all, she added, but adaptable and fast-responding jabs could be the best option. Earlier, Labour accused the government of not doing enough to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online and called for emergency laws brought in. It wants financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"". His party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine, he said. The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content. Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service.",2020-11-15T14:22:50,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54949799,2020-11-15 16:11:06.803732,BBC,world,0
US Election 2020: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive,"By Jack Goodman, Christopher Giles, Olga Robinson and Jake HortonBBC Reality Check Donald Trump's supporters have claimed that thousands of votes were cast in the US election using the names of people who had died. ""I may be 72,"" Maria Arredondo from Michigan told us when we called her. ""But I'm alive and breathing. My mind is working fine and I'm healthy.""  Maria said she had voted for Joe Biden and was surprised to hear that her name had appeared on a list of supposedly dead voters in the state. We spoke to other people in similar situations to that of Maria in Michigan and found similar stories. There have been occasions in previous US elections of dead people having apparently voted. This could happen through clerical errors or perhaps other family members with similar names voting with their ballots, but Trump supporters have alleged this has happened on a massive scale at this election. We set out to find out whether there is evidence for this claim.  The story starts with a list of around 10,000 names posted on Twitter by a Trump-supporting activist.  It purports to be of people who have died, but who have also voted in the presidential election in Michigan. Claims such as this have been repeated many times on different social-media platforms, including by Republican legislators. The list of 10,000 contains the name, zip code, and the date a ballot was received. It then lists a full date of birth and a full date of death. Some of the people supposedly died more than 50 years ago. Michigan has a database that lets you enter someone's name, zip code, month of birth and year of birth and allows you to see if they voted by absentee ballot this year. So you can easily check whether people on the list voted. There are also several US websites that include databases of death records.   But there's a fundamental problem with this list of 10,000.   With an exercise like this you are going to find false matches - somebody born in January 1940 voted in Michigan in the election, and there was somebody born somewhere else in the US in January 1940 who has the same name and is now dead. This will happen a lot in a country as big as the US (328 million people), and particularly with common names. To test the list, we picked 30 names at random. To this we added the oldest person on the list. Of this list of 31 names, we managed to speak directly to 11 people (or to a family member, neighbour or care home worker) to confirm they were still alive. For 17 others, there was no public record of their death, and we found clear evidence that they were alive after the alleged date of death on the list of 10,000. A clear pattern emerged - the wrong records had been joined together to create a false match. Finally, we found that three people on the list were indeed dead. We examine these cases later. The first thing we did was to check the official Michigan electoral database  to see whether our 31 individuals had sent in ballots - they all had. We then looked at the death records and quickly became suspicious on seeing that the vast majority did not die in Michigan, but elsewhere in the US. We wondered whether we could find people of the same name currently living in Michigan. Checking Michigan state public records, cross-referencing voter postal codes, we were able to find precise dates of birth for those who had voted - and as we had anticipated, they failed to match the dates of birth on the death records.   So we could be confident that we were dealing with two sets of people - those who had voted and those with the same name and age who had died elsewhere. But what we really wanted to do was to speak to the voters themselves.  We called Roberto Garcia, a retired teacher in Michigan. He told us: ""I'm definitely alive and I definitely voted for Biden - I would have to have been dead to vote for Trump."" We also found a 100-year-old woman who, according to the ""dead voter"" list, had died in 1982. She was alive and is currently living in a nursing home in Michigan. But the results of our search weren't always so straightforward.  When we looked for another centenarian, who according to the list had died in 1977, we found that she had still been alive when her postal ballot was returned in September. However, a neighbour told us the woman had died just a few weeks ago. We also found a matching obituary from October to confirm this. If a voter dies before election day after submitting their ballot, the Michigan authorities say the ballot will be rejected.  We have not been able to establish whether her ballot was counted. For those we couldn't reach by phone, we wanted to use other means to confirm they were alive. These included public records of, for example, business activities, from state and local authorities. For one woman who was supposed to have died in 2006 we found an annual company statement signed under her name from January 2020.  Two other men on our list of 31 died some time ago, yet votes had been cast in their names - with the correct postcodes and years of birth - according to the voting database.  We found that for both men, there were sons with the same name currently registered at the same address as their deceased fathers.  In both cases, a ballot was sent in for the dead fathers.   Local election officials told us that one of the votes had been counted but there was no record of the son having voted.  In the other, it was the son who actually voted, but it had been recorded as the father's due to a clerical error.  Our selection of 31 cases is only a small sample of the 10,000 names on the list, but it has clearly revealed the flaws in the database shared by Trump supporters. From our investigation it's clear that in almost all of our 31 test cases, the data for genuine voters in Michigan has been combined with records of dead people with the same name and birth month and year from across the United States to yield false matches. ""If the lists are linked based on name and birth date alone, in a state the size of Michigan, you're guaranteed to get false positives,"" says Prof Justin Levitt, an expert on the law of democracy.  It's known as the birthday problem - the high probability that two students in the same class share the same birthday.   So if you compare millions of voters in Michigan with a database of deaths across the United States you're bound to find cross-over, particularly if the voter database doesn't include the day of the month on which a person is born. ""It's simply a matter of statistics that if you cross-reference millions of records with millions of other records, you'll get a sizable number of false positive matches.  We've seen this before,"" says Prof Justin Levitt. With her vote safely cast, and counted, Maria Arredondo tells us she's looking forward to the new administration. ""He was a great vice-president under Obama. I'm so pleased. A weight has lifted off my shoulders.""

Covid-19: New 'mega labs' in early 2021 to speed up testing,"Two new ""mega labs"" will open in early 2021 to try to double the UK's daily coronavirus testing capacity, the government has said. The sites - at Leamington Spa in the Midlands and another at an unconfirmed site in Scotland - will increase testing capacity by 600,000. The latest data shows current capacity is around 519,000 - although the number of tests actually processed is lower. Meanwhile, Labour is calling for a national plan to roll out the vaccine. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccination programme will probably be the largest logistical operation since World War Two - and called for a plan setting out who will be eligible for a jab and when. Testing is considered a key way to control the epidemic, but the government's system has experienced setbacks during the pandemic. In recent weeks, the government has started to pilot mass testing - including people with no symptoms - using a new type of rapid swab tests which do not need to be sent to a lab. However, the bulk of the UK's testing still uses the standard swab test that need to be analysed in a lab. Announcing the two new ""mega labs"", the government said they will use technology to speed up the process - for example through automation and robotics. ""This means more tests will be processed more quickly and at a lower cost, and therefore faster turnaround times for test results,"" the Department of Health said. And the sites will create up to 4,000 jobs, with the labs also being used to process tests for other illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.  They would each add 300,000 to the UK's daily testing capacity - defined as how many tests can be processed in the lab each day - when operating at maximum.  The testing capacity is different to how many tests are actually processed. For example, the latest figures for Friday showed that although the UK's capacity was 519,951, the number of tests carried out was 379,955. Officials have previously said it is natural that not all the capacity is used up, and there needs to be flexibility in the system to cope with surges in demand or problems with equipment or staff. On the face of it the planned new ""mega labs"" will mark a significant boost to UK testing capacity. The current capability of 500,000 tests a day will be more than doubled when the two labs are up and running.  But the big unanswered question is when? The timing is vague with only an aim for an opening early next year. The site for the Scottish lab has not yet been announced. Previous pledges on testing capacity have not always been met.  A new ""lighthouse lab"" at Charnwood in the East Midlands was due to open in early October.  That didn't happen although government sources say it will come online ""in the coming months"" along with three others.  Plans are one thing. Delivery is another. More details of the ""mega labs"" will be closely scrutinised when they are published.  ""We didn't go into this crisis with a significant diagnostics industry, but we have built one, and these two mega labs are another step forward,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""These mega labs are future-proofing our national infrastructure to respond to future epidemics and improving care for other diseases."" The Scotland lab - which will be rolled out after Leamington Spa - will create about 1,800 jobs, the Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said. Separately, the NHS announced it is launching 40 clinics specialising in ""long Covid"" which will start opening at the end of November. The condition is thought to affect more than 60,000 people in the UK. Meanwhile, hope of a Covid vaccine being rolled out continues.  At the weekend, the co-founder of pharmaceutical company BioNTech, whose vaccine with Pfizer has shown positive early results, said life should be back to normal by next winter. Prof Ugur Sahin said if everything continued to go well, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the ""end of this year, beginning of next year"". Labour's Sir Keir has called on Boris Johnson to publish a national action plan for rolling out a vaccine ""that harnesses all of the talents of the British people: our businesses, nurses, doctors, scientists and public servants"". He said the government should consider supporting councils to refurbish town halls or sport centres into local vaccine clinics, and also launch a nationwide public health campaign to crack down on vaccine fake news. ""We are world leaders in vaccines, and I believe we should be aiming for a world class programme for rolling it out,"" he said. Last week, BioNTech and Pfizer became the first vaccine developers to share preliminary analysis that showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. Their vaccine is one of 11 in the final stages of testing.  However, there is no data yet to show how well the jab works in the elderly, and it is also not known if it stops people spreading the disease, as well as getting sick. The UK has ordered enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  The agency's head has said it would not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a vaccine quickly. The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

Newspaper headlines: New vaccine 'hope' and lockdown 'looms over Christmas',"By BBC NewsStaff The news about a second, effective coronavirus vaccine is widely reported. The Guardian claims the government ""scrambled"" to secure five million doses of Moderna's jab within four hours of the announcement that it was almost 95% effective ""amid fears that Britain had missed out"".  The Metro warns that the UK is at the ""back of the queue"" after ""dozens of countries ordered hundreds of millions of doses in deals going back to the summer"".  The Independent website says Britain's supplies are unlikely to be available before the spring - meaning our immediate hope for vaccination ""rests in the hands of Pfizer and the candidate being developed by Oxford University"". With the headline ""lockdown looms over Christmas"", the Telegraph says Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted that the current restrictions in England could last beyond the start of next month. The paper also features a warning by Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor to NHS testing, who said a ""strengthened"" tier system would be needed even if the lockdown ended as scheduled on 2 December. The Mail is more optimistic and claims victory in its campaign to allow care home residents to be hugged by their families over the festive season, after Mr Hancock said the testing of visitors would be rolled out nationwide within weeks. But the Mirror says care home bosses are demanding extra funding to avoid a repeat of PPE and Test and Trace failures - warning it is ""dangerous"" to raise expectations without policies in place. The Times claims to have learned that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering a temporary cut to Britain's aid spending - from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5% - to help repair what it calls ""the nation's Covid-ravaged public finances"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak is said to be pressing for the move to be announced in next week's comprehensive spending review, with his allies arguing that cutting the aid budget is a political necessity at a time when domestic spending will be limited. According to the paper, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is opposed to any cut, warning it would have a detrimental impact on Britain's global standing. Concerns about coronavirus safety in government are highlighted by the Guardian - as Mr Johnson and a number of other Conservative MPs continue to self-isolate after attending an event at Downing Street alongside a colleague who later tested positive.  It reports the ""serious doubts"" expressed by a union representing civil servants over the competency levels of ministers to follow safety measures, but points out that maintaining space from others within No 10 is hampered by the building's narrow ""rat runs"" and ""pinch points"".  The Mirror complains that the prime minister ""has built a career on flouting rules"" and insists that we must all obey the social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of the virus.   Sign up for a morning briefing direct to your inbox The Sun says it can reveal that Britain's chief Brexit negotiator, Lord Frost, has told Mr Johnson to expect a trade deal with the EU ""early next week"".  The paper's leader column urges the prime minister to ""stand firm"" in what it calls ""these pivotal final days"". It warns ""a sell-out is the certain road to rapid political ruin"".  ""No deal is the harder road"", it admits, ""but the only one for which Mr Johnson has a mandate if Brussels remains intransigent"".     According to the Mail, there are ""serious flaws"" in the government's plan to accelerate the switch to electric cars - after Freedom of Information requests revealed 84% of councils have no on-street charging points. The paper's editorial questions whether Boris Johnson seriously believes that millions of people are preoccupied by what it calls the ""fashionable green causes"" close to the heart of his fiancÃ©e and warns that the support of former Labour ""red wall"" voters could be lost, if the prime minister ""embraces ardent environmentalism at the expense of levelling up"". After inspiring what the Sun calls ""a double government U-turn on free school meals"", Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford has told the paper he's launching a book club to encourage more young children to read. He says his family didn't have the budget to buy books when he was growing up, meaning he was 17 before he began reading for pleasure - and he wants all children to enjoy the escapism books can provide, not just those who can afford it. The Sun says the club will work with charities to provide free books to children from vulnerable and under-privileged backgrounds when it launches next year.        Finally, the Times says the creator of ""The Crown"" has defended writing fictional scenes in the latest series of the historical drama, after royal commentators accused it of ""wild crude distortions"".  Peter Morgan is quoted as saying he ""really believed"" he had represented the views of Lord Mountbatten when he ""made up"" details of the final conversations between Prince Charles and his great uncle. But the Guardian columnist, Simon Jenkins, is not persuaded, insisting: ""There cannot be one truth for historians and journalists, and another truth called artistic licence.""",2020-11-17T05:56:36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-54968462,2020-11-17 09:55:31.573881,BBC,world,0
Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work?,"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News Employers are cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs as Covid-19 continues to hit the economy. While many parts of the country went into lockdown to combat the spread of the virus, unemployment numbers have been rising sharply. How high could the unemployment rate go? The most widely used measure is the unemployment rate. It counts how many people are able to work and want a job, but can't find one.  The most recent unemployment rate - for July to September - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  That is an increase of 0.7% over the previous three months, and meant that 1.62 million people were unemployed. However, this number is always based on surveys taken in previous months and is not right up to date. Some of the data was gathered in July and August, when infection rates were falling, and large parts of the economy were reopening. So this figure is likely to carry on rising in coming months. Most economists expect unemployment to continue rising for the rest of the year. In its most recent set of forecasts the Bank of England said that unemployment would most likely peak at about 7.7% in April to June of next year. There was a high degree of uncertainty around that forecast, with a small chance that it could rise as high as 10%. However, those forecasts don't take into account the government's decision to extend the furlough scheme to the end of March. The government has been trying to protect jobs through a number of measures. The largest is the furlough scheme, where it pays most of the wages for workers when their employers cannot. That has prevented many of those people becoming unemployed. However, the furlough scheme was being wound down in September and October, ahead of its planned closure on 31 October.  Many companies cut jobs in preparation for the end of the scheme, and July to September saw a record rise in the number of redundancies of 181,000.  The government has now announced an extension to the scheme for another five months, which it hopes will protect more jobs.  The easing of lockdown restrictions across the summer also boosted the numbers of people counted as unemployed.  People who weren't looking for a job during the first lockdown were considered ""economically inactive"", and weren't included in the figures. But as the rules changed, they began to look for work and were therefore classed as unemployed.  The figures for July to September saw a record number of people move from inactive to unemployed -  215,000.  One of the hardest-hit groups has been young people. The figures show that 174,000 fewer 16- to 24-year-olds were employed in July to September, compared to the previous three months.   The ONS says that this is because young people are more likely to be working in areas such as hotels, restaurants and tourism. Jobs like these have been particularly hard-hit by lockdown, and quarantine restrictions have reduced the number of tourists. The latest official statistics capture the state of the country before a lockdown across all of England was announced, and the extension of the furlough scheme. They do show a picture of many things improving, although that may not last.  The total number of hours people worked in July to September increased as parts of the economy reopened and people returned to work.  The average amount people earn had been falling sharply during the crisis, but it rose 1.9% in the latest figures (excluding bonuses). The number of job vacancies available also continued to increase, but there are still 35% less than a year ago. The start of the pandemic saw a big increase in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, which was much bigger than the rise in the number of people counted as unemployed.  In October 2020 the number of people claiming either Jobseeker's Allowance or universal credit because they were ""searching for work"" was 2.6 million, 1.4 million higher than March, before the pandemic had begun to take effect.  However, some of these people are working, but with low earnings either because they are on low wages or short hours.  The ONS says it cannot tell how many of those people are out of work, or whether they are now able to get universal credit because the rules for claiming it have changed.

Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 under PM's green plan,"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030, Boris Johnson has said.  But some hybrids would still be allowed, he confirmed. It is part of what the prime minister calls a ""green industrial revolution"" to tackle climate change and create jobs in industries such as nuclear. Critics of the plan say the Â£4bn allocated is far too small for the scale of the challenge. The total amount of new money announced in the package is a 25th of the projected Â£100bn cost of high-speed rail, HS2.  The government says it is part of a broader Â£12bn package of public investment that is expected to draw in much more private sector funding. The plan includes provision for a large nuclear plant - likely to be at Sizewell in Suffolk - and for advanced small nuclear reactors, which it is hoped, will create an estimated 10,000 jobs at Rolls-Royce and other firms. The government hopes that as many as 250,000 jobs will be created overall - especially in the north of England and in Wales, with 60,000 in offshore wind. The clean energy revolution will also affect some people's homes. The government will bring forward, to 2023, the date by which new homes will need to be warmed without using gas heating. It will aim to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - these are low-energy electrical devices for warming homes. And it has extended the Green Homes Grant for home insulation for a year after the first tranche was massively over-subscribed. Clean hydrogen will be blended into the natural gas supply to reduce overall emissions from gas, and the government wants a town to volunteer for a trial of 100% hydrogen for heat, industry and cooking. The hydrogen - attracting a subsidy of up to Â£500m - will be produced in places such as north-east England, partly by energy from offshore wind.   The government wants to breathe new life into de-industrialised areas by teaming hydrogen production with the manufacture of wind turbines, and with four clusters of firms using carbon capture and storage. This is when emissions from chimneys are captured and forced into rocks underground. The hope is to transform depressed areas into high-tech hubs. This will get funding of an extra Â£200m. Another key point of the plan is a Â£1.3bn investment in electric vehicle (EV) charging points. Grants for EV buyers will stretch to Â£582m to help people make the transition. There is also nearly Â£500m for battery manufacture in the Midlands and north-east England.  In the race to clean up motoring, the UK is now in second place after Norway, which has a fossil fuel vehicle abolition date of 2025. UK car makers have warned about the scale of the challenge, but the government believes that forcing technological change can give firms a competitive edge. But will the ""green revolution"" achieve its aim of massive job creation? Experts said the Â£4bn would go a long way if it were spent on labour-intensive insulation, but not far if ploughed into expensive, mechanised carbon capture. The prime minister said: ""My 10-point plan will create, support and protect hundreds of thousands of green jobs, whilst making strides towards net zero by 2050.  ""Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future."" The prime minister made it clear that his plans aim to create jobs and address climate change at the same time. This time next year he will host an international climate summit in Glasgow, known as COP.  The COP - or COP26 UN summit, which was postponed by 12 months because of the pandemic - is seen as the most important round of talks to tackle climate change since the Paris Agreement in 2015. The plans are aimed to put the UK on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband criticised the plan, saying that the funding ""in this long-awaited"" announcement does not ""remotely meet the scale of what is needed"" to tackle unemployment and the climate emergency. ""Only a fraction of the funding announced today is new."" He said Labour wanted the government to bring forward Â£30bn of capital investment over the next 18 months and invest it in low-carbon sectors to support 400,000 additional jobs.  The Green Party called for a transformation of the entire economy to reduce emissions, including scrapping the Â£27bn road-building programme, which will actually increase emissions. Mike Hulme, professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge, said critics should not ""nit-pick about precise details"" of the plan as it was ""far more important is to endorse the direction of travel that has been set for the next decade"". Tanya Steele from WWF-UK said the government had ""fired the starting gun on the action we need to see"".  She added: ""We now need the chancellor to live up to the ambition expressed today through a spending review that tests every line of public spending to ensure it's compatible with meeting our climate goals.""

Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online People around the UK must now wear face coverings in many public places. But what protection do they offer, and what sort of coverings can be worn? Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.  They should mainly be worn to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself.  When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission.  They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms, or are yet to develop them. There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing. Face coverings are now compulsory across the UK when: People can be refused travel for not following the rules or fined as a last resort. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. In England and Scotland, face coverings are also compulsory in a number of indoor spaces, including:  Scotland also requires face coverings to be worn in indoor spaces, such as staff canteens and corridors in workplaces. It no longer requires couples to wear them when exchanging marriage vows. In Wales, face coverings must be worn in all indoor public places by customers and staff.  In Northern Ireland, they must be worn in ""any other indoor place where goods or services are available to buy or rent"". Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include: You can remove your mask if: Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation. The government does not recommend wearing face coverings in schools and colleges because of the controls already in place. However, each nation is adopting different rules: However, they will be mandatory for schools in parts of England that are under local restrictions, but not in classrooms.   The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.  The government has issued its own advice too. Face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection as the masks that healthcare workers wear.  World Health Organization (WHO) advice says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. They help us protect each other and reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms, or are yet to develop symptoms.",2020-10-30T15:13:17,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,2020-11-13 14:49:22.644762,BBC,travel,0
Hundreds send birthday cards to Birmingham boy,"Hundreds of people have sent birthday cards to a nine-year-old boy after an appeal by his family. Oscar Jealous, from Kingstanding in Birmingham, was diagnosed with life-limiting Batten disease in February.  His family put out a plea for cards about 10 days ago and said they had been ""overwhelmed"" by the response.  His father, Alex, said they wanted to do something to ""make Oscar feel special"" and give him a birthday to remember on Sunday. Thousands of pounds have already been raised to help Oscar's family pay for his specialist care and also to help him fulfil a ""bucket list of dream days"".  Oscar's condition means he is losing his sight, will gradually lose speech and mobility and is developing dementia. ""The intention when he was diagnosed was to have a big family party in the garden,"" Mr Jealous said.  ""The simple fact is, it is more likely that next year will be very different, this is probably going to be the last birthday where he understands what is going on."" Mr Jealous said they had received more than 500 cards, about 20 presents and were expecting a ""mountain"" of balloons to be delivered on Oscar's birthday. ""It is a very overwhelming thing, but at the same time it is nice,"" he said.  ""It highlights how supported we are as a family, not just from close friends and family but from the wider community. ""It is about memory making so we have things, and his brother has things, that we can sit and look back on.""  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

In pictures: Connecting the world's redheads,"By Steven BrocklehurstBBC Scotland News Over the past seven years, Scottish photographer Kieran Dodds has been taking pictures of people from around the world with ginger hair. Kieran himself is ""pale and ginger"", what he calls a clichÃ© of Scottish national identity, but he wants to use the hair colour to illustrate a global phenomenon. ""It's not about hair,"" he says. ""It's about humanity and how we are all made of the same stuff. With the ginger hair you can see that connection."" Scotland is an international hot spot for redheads and Kieran had no trouble finding and photographing them in his homeland. But he also attended World Redhead Day in London, where he met people from around the globe. He then travelled to the Russian city of Perm, another ginger hotspot, which is as far east as Iran and is at a similar latitude to the north of Scotland. Redheads are more common in northern latitudes as the gene adaptation allows for the absorption of vitamin D with little sunlight. However, Kieran also travelled to the Caribbean to photograph red-haired Jamaicans in a place called Treasure Beach, a result of a complex genetic inheritance which is likely to have involved Scottish sailors and settlers. The result of Kieran's project is a book called Gingers.  He chose the title despite the term often being used as an insult. ""I feel like it is actually quite a good description,"" he says. ""Because the hair colour is not red like a post-box or your blood, it is a mixture of gold and yellow and red all mixed together."" The 39-year-old says his own experience of growing up with ginger hair was echoed in many of the conversations he had with the people he photographed, no matter where in the world they grew up. ""It is very similar for most places,"" he says. ""It is something that people thought was amazing and complimented you for as a kid. ""Then there is this period of primary school into secondary where it is a very visible trait and you stand out for it, so you get abuse or stupid insults. ""But once you are through that, if you have not come out too badly, people start to embrace it, almost as their unique selling point, their special power, and see it as an important part of their identity."" Kieran says the one place where he found a totally different attitude was Jamaica, where nobody he talked to said they had experienced negative comments. ""I kept trying to work out why,"" he says. ""But I think it might just be to do with it being such a diverse country. Difference is the norm and this is just another difference."" Kieran says he began the project in 2013 in the run-up to Scotland's independence referendum, which got him thinking about the clichÃ©d image of Scottish identity. He says that even within Scotland, thought to have a higher percentage of natural redheads than anywhere else in the world, people with ginger hair were a small minority. He wanted to show how even that tiny section of humanity was not an homogenous group.  ""The ginger hair is how people see us Scots,"" he says. ""I thought 'I want to use that clichÃ©' and show that even in this tiny group there is diversity of look, background and opinion.  ""If you live here, you realise the Scots are an incredibly diverse varied group."" At the same time, he made a visit to the National Gallery of Scotland where he discovered that the artists of the Renaissance had celebrated, even revered, ginger hair. ""I went in the Renaissance room and noticed that every single painting had a ginger person in it,"" he says. ""I thought it was funny that southern European painters were documenting Middle Eastern characters, usually Jesus and Mary, as ginger. ""That intrigued me because these are people that are seen as divine."" Kieran says seeing these divine characters with ginger hair made him see that normal people had the same dignity. That is why there are no famous ginger-haired people in the book. ""I did not want people to be distracted by some famous ginger person,"" he says.  ""I want to look at normal, everyday people, your neighbour basically, and see that person is amazing, if you look."" It had been thought ginger hair was controlled by a single gene, MC1R, with versions passed on from both parents. However, more recent discoveries have suggested eight genes could be involved. Less than 2% of the world's population are thought to have red hair. In Scotland, the figure is thought to be about 13% - approximately 700,000 people. Scotland is such a ginger hot spot that when Kieran appealed on social media for red-haired people to be photographed he was overwhelmed by the response. The same was true in the Russian city of Perm, where he also put out a social media call. ""My local assistant did not believe it was going to be a big thing and then he was inundated with people,"" Kieran says. The book is published on Friday 20 November and Kieran says: ""I hope everyone can stare and wonder and enjoy the beauty of humanity. ""But also they can see themselves and understand that they've come from somewhere across deep-time. We are all part of a travelling species and I wanted to make those connections.""

Covid symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent There are three main symptoms of coronavirus. If you get just one of them, you should get a test. Public Health England says about 85% of people with Covid will have at least one.  If you have any of these symptoms you should get a test as soon as possible and not leave home for any other reason.  Anyone you live with, or who is in your support bubble, should also self-isolate until the test result arrives. It takes five days on average from the moment you are infected to start showing the symptoms, but the World Health Organization says it can take up to 14 days. If the test is positive, your whole household must all continue to follow self-isolation rules. No. The coronavirus can affect multiple organs and has several less common symptoms. Scientists using data on the health of four million people say Covid has six sub-types. Symptoms include: And researchers think that vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps could be a sign of coronavirus infection in children. Lots of other viruses have similar symptoms to Covid, including flu and other infections. This will be a particular problem over winter when these bugs are more common.  Public Health England says just under half of people who have one of the three main Covid symptoms will not have it. However, they should still get a test. If you have a positive test result you should self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from the time symptoms started. You must stay away from other members of your household, who must self-isolate for at least 14 days. Most people will have only mild symptoms, which can be managed with pain relief (like paracetamol), bed rest and plenty of fluids. You should not even go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. If you are seriously unwell and you have a medical emergency you should call 999 - this includes feeling so breathless that you cannot speak more than a few words. If you are concerned your symptoms are getting worse, use the NHS 111 website England, NHS Inform in Scotland or the equivalents in Wales and Northern Ireland. The main reason people need hospital care is for difficulty breathing where they may be given oxygen. The most seriously ill patients may require ventilation where the patient is sedated and air is pushed into their lungs. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.  So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. Face coverings are also compulsory in many indoor settings across the UK.

Trump fires election security official who contradicted him,"Donald Trump says he has fired a top election official who contradicted the US president's claims of voter fraud. President Trump said he ""terminated"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief Chris Krebs for his ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on vote integrity. Mr Trump has refused to concede the US election, and has made unsubstantiated claims of ""massive"" voter fraud. Election officials said the vote was the ""most secure"" in US history.  Mr Krebs is the latest official to be dismissed by the US president following his defeat, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper also shown the door amid reports Mr Trump doubted the Pentagon chief's loyalty. There is speculation in Washington DC that before Mr Trump leaves office in January, CIA director Gina Haspel and FBI director Christopher Wray could also be for the chopping block. Like many others fired by Mr Trump, Mr Krebs reportedly only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet on Tuesday. But following his dismissal, the former Microsoft executive appeared to have no regrets. Honored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomrorow. #Protect2020 He had run the agency from its inception two years ago in the aftermath of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. To guard against potential cyber-threats, Cisa works with state and local election officials and the private companies that supply voting systems, while monitoring ballot tabulation and the power grid. He had reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over a Cisa website called Rumor Control, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden.  Mr Krebs tweeted: ""ICYMI: On allegations that election systems were manipulated, 59 election security experts all agree, 'in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.' #Protect2020"". This post, and others by Mr Krebs dating back to the end of July this year, appear to have been deleted from his Twitter account. He was among senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security who last week declared the 3 November US general election the ""most secure in American history"", while rejecting ""unfounded claims"". Though that statement did not name Mr Trump, on the same day it was published Mr Krebs retweeted a Twitter post by an election law expert saying: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Mr Krebs' dismissal brought outrage from Democrats. A spokesman for President-elect Joe Biden said ""Chris Krebs should be commended for his service in protecting our elections, not fired for telling the truth"".  As Cisa director, Mr Krebs' voice carried weight. His analysis of accusations of mass voter fraud is simple to summarise: there is no evidence of mass voter fraud.  He knew his words would displease President Trump. Last Thursday he told associates he expected to be fired, and he was right.  He was put in an impossible position. Mr Trump said that his statements were inaccurate because of ""massive improprieties and fraud"" during the election.  But Mr Krebs' didn't find that.  Perhaps the president will produce a trove of material backing his statements up, but as yet he hasn't found evidence of this either.  Mr Krebs was therefore put in a position no one wants to be in - appease Donald Trump and say what he wants to hear - or risk his career by saying things his master would take umbrage to.  He chose the latter, and paid for it with his job.  Mr Trump's campaign and its allies have filed a barrage of lawsuits in battleground states contesting the results, although election officials say no evidence of widespread irregularities has been found. Time is running out. All outstanding election disputes nationwide must be resolved by 8 December. The official results are set to be confirmed when the US Electoral College meets on 14 December. On Tuesday, Republican members of a bipartisan election board in Michigan refused to certify Mr Biden's projected win in that state, only to back down after an outcry. The two Republicans on the four-member board had objected to minor voting irregularities in Wayne County, home to Detroit. But they relented after Democrats accused them of trying to disenfranchise voters in the majority-black city. As a compromise, the board passed a resolution requesting that Michigan's Democratic secretary of state conduct an audit of the jurisdictions involved.  Meanwhile, election officials conducting a by-hand recount in Georgia - where a fraction of a percent separates the two rivals - found more uncounted ballots for the second time this week. Almost 2,800 previously untallied ballots were discovered on Tuesday in Fayette County, a day after 2,600 uncounted votes turned up in Floyd County. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system manager, blamed human error. The discoveries are expected to shave Mr Biden's lead in the state to under 13,000, not enough to flip Georgia into Mr Trump's column. There was another setback for Mr Trump on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, where the state supreme court rejected his campaign's argument that its observers had been denied sufficient rights to watch ballot counts in Philadelphia. Also on Tuesday, the Trump campaign, along with Nevada's Republican party, filed another lawsuit challenging that state's election results. Mr Biden is the projected victor in Nevada, but the latest legal action asked a judge to declare Mr Trump the winner, or annul the race altogether. Judges have rejected other Trump campaign lawsuits disputing the tally in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, after ruling there was no evidence to support claims of systemic fraud.",2020-11-18T05:08:20,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54982360,2020-11-18 08:16:32.586934,BBC,politics,0
Covid: Who will have the Pfizer vaccine first and when can I get it?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent A vaccine which can prevent nine out of 10 people getting Covid-19 is set to be put forward for emergency approval. Its developers, Pfizer and BioNTech, said it had been tested on 43,500 people, with no safety concerns raised. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of vaccine called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus' genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. It is given in two doses - three weeks apart - and early data suggests it protects more than 90% of people from developing Covid symptoms. There are no RNA vaccines that have been approved for use in humans.  The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, and they will decide whether the jab can be approved for use.    It depends how old you are, as age is the biggest risk factor for severe Covid-19. In the UK, older care home residents and care home staff are top of the preliminary priority list. They are followed by health workers such as hospital staff and the over 80s. People are then ranked by age, with people under 50 at the bottom of the list.  The first jabs may take place before Christmas if everything goes smoothly. The vaccine will be delivered through care homes, GPs and pharmacists as well as ""go-to"" vaccination centres set up in venues such as sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges to overcome - such as the need to keep the vaccine at minus 80C during transportation from the manufacturing lab to vaccination venues. The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient and can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being administered. It is impossible to know and we will find the answer only by waiting.  If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have a vaccine every year, in the same way as for flu. The data did not show whether protection from Covid-19 was the same in all age groups. However, earlier studies did suggest young and old people could produce an immune response.  There will also be some people - such as those with a weak immune system - who will not be able to have the vaccine.  Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks.  The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects have been reported.   If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures for controlling the virus.  The challenge, however, is getting from now to that point.  There is still the monumental challenge of manufacturing enough vaccine and actually getting it into people. It is all going to take time and we need something to control the virus until then. So, testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet.  Viruses mutate all the time, it's what they do. The question is, will they mutate in a way that changes their behaviour?  So far there is no sign of that happening, but it is possible that in the future the virus may change so the vaccine becomes less effective.  If that happens, then a new coronavirus vaccine may need to be designed.  This is not unusual. A new flu vaccine is developed each year to try to match the strains of flu that are doing the rounds.  And the RNA vaccine technology is very easy to tweak so this should not be a major problem.   The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property.  They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. The announcement gave us the headline, but there is a still lack of fine detail. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups.  These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. It is good news. It shows that a coronavirus vaccine is possible, which we didn't know a couple of days ago. As many of the vaccines are targeting the same part of the virus - what's known as the spike protein - it raises hopes they will work too.  There are about a dozen vaccines in the final stages of clinical development.  No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time.  We are still waiting for the full data, but these results are even better than people were hoping for. A good flu vaccine protects around half of people, so 90% at the first attempt is a triumph.

Covid-19 in the US: Is this coronavirus wave the worst yet?,"By Mike HillsVisual journalist Americans may have tuned out of coronavirus news as they focused on the outcome of the presidential election, but the pandemic has quietly been getting worse in the country.  The number of infections in the US has reached new heights in recent days, surpassing 150,000 cases in one day for the first time since the outbreak began.  Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, has warned that the country faces ""a very challenging and ominous situation"" as it approaches winter.  So how bad is the situation and how much does it vary across the country? With more than 11 million confirmed cases, the US has the highest number of infections in the world and the spread of the virus shows no sign of slowing down.  The chart below shows that the current wave is growing at a faster rate than the previous two - although some of that is down to increased levels of testing.  During the spring wave, testing was mostly limited to confirming cases in people who were already in hospital, meaning the true scale of that outbreak wasn't fully captured. But the latest data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project shows the current surge is not just down to increased testing - the number of tests carried out in the US was up by 12.5% week on week, while the number of cases increased by more than 40%.  One likely cause is the change of season and colder weather driving people indoors to socialise, where the risk of spread is heightened due to less social distancing and poor ventilation. Because of the change in the level of testing, a better way to compare waves is to look at the number of people being admitted to hospital because of Covid-19.  This data shows that roughly the same number of people across the US were in hospital during the first and second waves of the outbreak. But there are already more people in hospital during the current wave - more than 60,000 at the moment.  One encouraging observation is that fewer coronavirus patients are being put on ventilators - for now at least - which shows the progress that has been made with other treatments since the spring outbreak.  In a recent study in New York, researchers found that the probability of death among coronavirus patients was down 18 percentage points from the spring, in part due to new treatments and better knowledge of the virus among medical staff.  But these improvements are dependent on the quality of care being received, which is put at risk when hospitals reach capacity and staffing levels are put under pressure. Despite the progress being made in fighting the infection, the number of daily deaths in the US is on the up once again.  On average, more than 1,000 people are now dying every day in America and recent daily spikes have been higher than those seen during the summer outbreak.  The worry is that deaths is a measure that lags behind cases and hospitalisations, because it can take several weeks for those who are worst-affected to die, so we could well see it rise to the levels of the spring outbreak in the next few weeks.  At the moment, the US death toll stands at about 250,000 - again the highest figure in the world and about a fifth of the global total of confirmed coronavirus deaths. The current wave of infections is the third one to hit the US this year but the one major difference is that it's affecting every region at the same time.  The spring wave was predominantly in the Northeast, while the summer one hit the South and West hardest. This time around, it's the Midwest where infections are rising fastest - but every region is seeing a spike in cases.  In March, as New York's healthcare system struggled to cope with a surge of coronavirus cases, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a plea to doctors and nurses across the country: ""Help New York. We are the ones who are hit now."" Healthcare professionals were able to answer that call because the outbreak was isolated to the Northeast, but if a similar call is made in the next few weeks it will be harder to answer now that cases are rising in every state.  At the moment, the worst outbreaks are in the Midwest, as the map below shows, and officials in some of the worst-hit states have warned that hospitals are already in a challenging situation.  Many of these more rural states had avoided wide outbreaks of coronavirus until recently, meaning there were often few restrictions already in place.  In North Dakota, the Republican governor had resisted calls for the wearing of face masks to be mandated but last week he issued an order enforcing it, saying the state's doctors and nurses ""need our help, and they need it now."" Other Republican governors have made similar moves.   There has been lots of positive news on the vaccine front in recent weeks, but however quick they are delivered will be too late to stop the current wave of infections.  Speaking to Chatham House last week, Dr Fauci said Americans must ""hang on"" until the vaccines arrive. ""The cavalry is coming but don't put your weapons down yet,"" he added.   He said people needed to ""double down"" on key public health measures like social distancing, the wearing of face masks, and washing hands but he also called for ""a much more uniform approach from all the states"".   That looks unlikely to happen under President Trump, who while urging Americans to remain vigilant, insisted last week: ""This administration will not be going to a lockdown."" President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make tackling the pandemic a top priority, but the third wave will have claimed the lives of tens of thousands more people before he takes charge.  One forecasting model run by experts at the University of Washington says the US could see another 100,000 deaths between now and 20 January, when Mr Biden enters the White House.

Newspaper headlines: Final chance for PM 'to get grip' and Queen's vow,"By BBC NewsStaff Dominic Cummings' departure had not been confirmed by the time the first editions were published - but was widely anticipated.  ""It's the beginning of the end"" is the Daily Telegraph's headline. It suggests Boris Johnson's chief adviser had been hugely weakened by the resignation of the communications director, Lee Cain.  The Times focuses on a new era it believes Boris Johnson is now planning. A Downing Street source suggests he will take a softer approach to Scotland, promoting the union, rather than just saying no to an independence referendum, and that he will push hard on a green agenda.  Calls to overhaul the No 10 operation have come from ""a string"" of Conservative MPs, according to the Guardian, with one suggesting it was time ""to get a grip"". A backbencher tells the Independent it's not about policy, but getting Downing Street to be more professional. England's former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has told the Telegraph that the UK was not as ready as it should have been for Covid-19.  In an interview with the paper, she blames Public Health England for assuring her that a coronavirus epidemic could ""never travel this far in big numbers from Asia"".  Public Health England dismisses the suggestion, saying Dame Sally took part in exercises planned specifically for a Mers outbreak in the UK. The i warns on its front page that the goal of a vaccine giving the UK herd immunity could put at risk by what it calls ""baseless safety fears"".  The i reports that online misinformation campaigns and genuine concerns have put a significant minority of people against inoculation.  But the scientist behind the first vaccine tells the Guardian he is confident the product can ""bash the virus over the head,"" and bring an end to the pandemic.  The head of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, explains that the regulatory authorities helped ensure the jab could be developed at speed. He compares it to crossing London with no traffic.

Covid vaccine: Major new trial starts in UK,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent A major trial of a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 has launched in the UK - the third such trial in the country.  The jab - designed by the Belgian company Janssen - uses a genetically modified common cold virus to train the immune system.  It comes a week after preliminary results showed another vaccine offered 90% protection.  However, many types of vaccine are likely to be needed to end the pandemic.  The success of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech has caused global excitement. However, it has not yet been approved for use and we still do not know how well it works in the elderly or how long immunity lasts.  The hunt for Covid vaccines continues as a different approach may yet be better, or better in some age groups, and one company will struggle to immunise the planet.  ""It is really important we pursue many different vaccines from many different manufactures,"" said Prof Saul Faust, the director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, who will run the trial. He added: ""We just don't know how each of these vaccines is going to behave and we can't be certain vaccine supply will be efficient and secure from one manufacturer."" The trial has started the job of recruiting 6,000 people in the UK. Other countries will join the effort to bring the total up to 30,000. Half of the volunteers will be given two doses of the vaccine around two months apart.  Janssen already has one large scale trial of its vaccine in which volunteers get one dose. This trial will see if two gives a stronger and longer lasting immunity.  It could take six to nine months before the results are available.  Hopes for the Janssen vaccine have been buoyed by Pfizer's preliminary data as they both target a part of the virus called the spike protein.  The seemingly successful jab injected part of the virus' genetic code into volunteers. The Janssen vaccine instead uses a common cold virus that has been genetically modified to make it harmless and to look more like coronavirus at a molecular level. This should train the immune system to recognise and fight coronavirus.   This approach is similar to the vaccine designed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, which is also being trialled in the UK. The subtle difference is the Janssen vaccine uses a virus that normally infects people and the Oxford group are using one that infects chimpanzees. But all these approaches are relatively new and experimental. The Novavax jab, which uses the more traditional method of injecting viral proteins to train the body, started in September in the UK.  In total 25,000 people are already taking part in Covid trials in the UK.  The UK government has already put in advanced orders for six Covid vaccines, including 30 million doses of the Janssen jab. Kate Bingham, the chairwoman of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said: ""Many vaccines are needed both here in the UK, and globally, to ensure we can provide a safe and effective vaccine for the whole population.  ""That is why the launch of this trial to establish the safety, effectiveness, and very importantly the durability, of the Janssen vaccine is so significant, and I would continue to encourage people to sign up and take part in vaccine trials.""",2020-11-16T01:05:23,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54951650,2020-11-16 08:05:42.147032,BBC,technology,1
'Ultimate entertainer' Des O'Connor dies aged 88,"Entertainer Des O'Connor has died at the age of 88, his agent has confirmed. The comedian, singer and TV host died on Saturday following a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire just over a week ago. He was known hosting his own chat show, as well as Take Your Pick and Countdown - and for his friendship with Morecambe and Wise. In a statement his agent said he was ""well loved by absolutely everybody"" and ""loved life"". His long-time agent and family friend Pat Lake-Smith described him as the ""ultimate entertainer"" and said he had been recovering from the fall before his condition had suddenly deteriorated. She said: ""He was a joy to work with - he was talented, fun, positive, enthusiastic, kind and a total professional. He loved life, and considered enthusiasm almost as important as oxygen."" London-born O'Connor presented his own prime-time TV shows for more than 45 years but also had success as a singer. His friendship with comedy duo Morecambe and Wise saw him mocked for his singing ability in sketches despite a successful career which included four Top 10 hits and more than 30 albums. O'Connor appeared on stages around the world including hundreds of shows at the London Palladium. His fame soared when he was hired to host The Des O'Connor Show, which ran on ITV from 1963 to 1971. In 1977 he began hosting Des O'Connor tonight, which started on BBC Two before moving to ITV, where it stayed until it ended in 2002. He later hosted the Channel 4 quiz show Countdown alongside Carol Vorderman, with the pair bowing out together in 2008, and was made a CBE for his services to entertainment and broadcasting in that year's birthday honours.  O'Connor was married four times, and has described the end of his first three relationships as casualties of his obsession with work.  In 2007, he married long-term girlfriend Jodie Brooke Wilson, who was 37 years his junior and gave birth to their son Adam when O'Connor was 72. Tributes have been paid following his death, with Countdown co-host Vorderman saying he was a born entertainer and it had been a ""complete joy to work with him"". She told BBC News: ""I grew up throughout the Dennis O'Connor years, when he was on the television all the time, on Des O'Connor Tonight and the Morecambe and Wise shows.  ""Up to 20 million people would sit around the television and watch and laugh, and I mean laugh until they cried.  ""He was the king; he was one of the very great British television entertainers."" Fellow Countdown star Susie Dent described him as a ""true gent"" while Call the Midwife star Stephen McGann said O'Connor ""never took himself too seriously"". Melanie Sykes, who hosted TV show Today With Des And Mel alongside O'Connor, said it was an ""education and a privilege to work with him"". She wrote on Instagram: ""He had talent in every fibre of his being and was stubborn as a mule. He was the full ticket as a friend and colleague."" Broadcaster Tony Blackburn said ""he was a great entertainer and more importantly a very nice person"", and TV presenter Gyles Brandreth described him as ""the ultimate professional"". Speaking about his sketches with Morecambe and Wise, comedian David Baddiel said: ""RIP Des O' Connor. It's worth remembering how brilliant he is at his own expense in these sketches."" Northampton Town Football Club also joined the tributes to their former reserve player. The club said: ""We are very sorry to learn of the passing of Des O'Connor. Des famously played for our reserve team on a few occasions just after World War Two. Our thoughts are with all who knew Des."" O'Connor leaves behind his wife Jodie, their son Adam, and his four daughters, Karin, TJ, Samantha and Kristina. Did you meet Des O'Connor or work with him?

Covid-19: Coronavirus infections 'slowing down' and a couple reunite,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  The UK's R number - which rates the disease's ability to spread -  has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes as the Office for National Statistics says the number of people infected with coronavirus in the UK is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the North West but rising in the South and Midlands. Areas in the west of Scotland have been warned they may be placed under the highest level of Covid restrictions next week. Councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas have been told it is possible that restrictions may need to be increased from level three to level four. This would result in the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said case numbers were ""so stubbornly high"" in some level three areas that it raised a question of whether the restrictions were doing enough to suppress the virus. Liverpool's mayor says about 90,000 people were tested for coronavirus in the first week of the country's first city-wide testing programme, out of a population of about 500,000. A total of 430 people tested positive, with about 200 showing prior symptoms, Mayor Joe Anderson said. About 2,000 members of the military forces were drafted in to help at 38 test centres, including at leisure centres, church halls and Anfield Stadium. Elsewhere, Liverpool player Mohamed Salah has tested positive for coronavirus while on international duty with Egypt. Northern Ireland's first minister says she regrets how the executive has handled the decision over extending Covid-19 restrictions this week. The current restrictions in Northern Ireland were due to expire at midnight today, but on Thursday - after several days of disagreement - the executive announced they will be extended for one more week. There will be a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday. Arlene Foster said it had been a ""torturous example of how not to take decisions"". There has been a mixed reaction from businesses to the decision. Find out what the rules are where you live. It was an emotional reunion for one couple who have been married for 71 years but were forced to have five weeks apart because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Coronavirus: How to be happier while working from home,"By David BrownBBC News Millions of people need a home office for the first time. Some have perched at kitchen tables or made do with a laptop on the sofa for months.    But even if a vaccine comes soon, many people may never go back to the office full time. And the early signs of how the pandemic has affected the UK's mental health are not good.  Levels of depression have increased, while in a recent survey by the Royal Institute of British Architects many people said working from home had made them more stressed. So what can we do to keep us happier at home? ""People vary quite a lot in terms of personality type,"" says consultant psychiatrist Dr TBS Balamurali. ""But the guiding principles are very clear. Sunlight - alongside fresh air and access to nature - is fundamentally good for your mental health."" Sunlight triggers the brain to release the hormone serotonin. It helps people to feel calm and focussed, boosts their mood and reduces anxiety. Architect Ben Channon, head of wellbeing at Assael Architecture, says ""the benefits of daylight are huge"".  ""Sunlight is the starting block because it has such a big impact on the way we feel about a space - and on regulating sleep. Dealing with Covid has been exhausting for everyone, so that's particularly important right now.""  The good news, says Ben, is that ""people often have more control over light than they might think"". He says, if you can, to put your desk near a window.  Make sure you can draw the curtains back fully and clean the windows - inside and out. Dirt on windows can significantly reduce the amount of sunlight passing through them.   Also, use mirrors to bounce light around the room, and paint the room either white or a light colour also to reflect the light. And choose an upstairs room if you can - they almost always capture more sunlight, as do rooms with a higher ceiling. Dr Rebecca Dewey from the University of Nottingham, an expert in how the brain interprets sound, says different parts of your brain are constantly trying to recognise different noises and changes in sounds. ""That can be hugely distracting from trying to work,"" she says. ""Sharp noises are more of a problem than a low level babble."" And as some parts of your brain scan for changes: ""You might only get distracted when the noise stops."" Fellow neuroscientist Professor Adrian Rees of the University of Newcastle explains: ""Noise is tapping into your 'fight or flight' response."" A stressful sound induces an area of the brain called the amygdala to send out distress signals. They're picked up by another area of the brain, the hypothalamus, which in turn prompts the adrenal glands to pump adrenaline into the blood. Your blood pressure goes up.   ""It's partly about what the noise means to you,"" says Professor Rees. So, for example, your own child crying will be much harder to ignore than traffic noise of the same volume.  Earplugs might be a solution for some, but if you want to go further, soft furnishings, thicker carpets and heavier curtains to absorb the sound are some of the things architects suggest. If that doesn't do the trick, under-carpet boards, replacement ceilings, additional layers of plaster board on walls, and window shutters - without shutting out too much sunlight - can help. Studies have found that clutter can raise your level of cortisol, a stress hormone. That may be because clutter delivers conflicting stimuli to the brain, which then has to work harder to filter out unhelpful signals.   Environmental psychologist Dr Eleanor Ratcliffe, from Surrey University says: ""The problem with clutter is over-stimulation."" Normal levels of cortisol with occasional spikes are perfectly healthy, but chronically high levels of cortisol are associated with anxiety, depression, headaches and sleep disruption. ""You need to think about your need state"", Dr Ratcliffe says. While a certain amount of clutter in a relaxing home, may not be a problem, if it's now a workplace, ""you're in a different need state, you need to cut down on distraction"". So have a proper clear out, get organised, and get some proper storage if you can.  If you're not going to work, you may not be walking to the bus stop or the train station, or up and down long corridors to meetings and so on.   If your commute is now from the bedroom to the box room or the kitchen table, you're probably missing out on physical activity that can help keep you mentally as well as physically fit. Multiple studies have found that exercise is a natural anti-anxiety treatment, relieving stress, boosting physical and mental energy, and enhancing well-being through the release of endorphins.   ""Lack of exercise can have a real impact"", says Dr Ratcliffe. ""If people are missing out on exercise, they need to think about how their day is structured - and start making an explicit effort."" One option is to get a standing desk if you can - and use it properly. Stand some of the day, sit some of the day. But you can also take breaks and go for a walk.  ""The commute was also a kind of decompression time for many people,"" says Professor Gail Kinman, a fellow of the British Psychological Society.  ""It enabled people to put a clear boundary between their work and home life. When you're working at home the boundaries become permeable."" Getting out for regular exercise can give many home workers the decompression they need, she says. Many claims are made for the mental benefits of contact with the natural world: reducing blood pressure, anxiety, stress and rumination (endlessly going over the same thoughts) while improving attention, memory and sleep. Bringing plants and other natural objects and images into your home work space can have a significant impact. Dr Ratcliffe explains the theory of ""attention restoration"".  ""Looking at natural objects can give your brain a break - or a series of 'micro-breaks' from focusing. They take up your attention, but not in a demanding or over-stimulating way. That's helpful. ""We also associate nature with recreation and relaxation, so again that can help enhance our mood,"" she adds. Dr Balamurali says people who find themselves unhappy working at home need to think hard about what it is they miss about going to the office and try to compensate for whatever they've lost.   Top of the list, for many people, is social contact. More of us than we might expect get the majority - maybe 80 or 90% - of our social contact from being at work, he says. Whether that's chatting with colleagues in the office or the lunch queue, in the lift or on the stairs, it matters to a huge number of people.  ""When the lockdown came - all of that disappeared quite suddenly,"" says Dr Balamurali. ""It does depend what kind of personality you are, but many people need to get more real social contact in other ways.   ""So get out at lunchtime and in the evenings - connect with friends, family and neighbours - people you feel connected to."" Meeting others is obviously much harder in lockdown, but he suggests meeting another person to exercise with, or to walk with.  ""Humans are social animals,"" he adds. ""Staring into a screen on Zoom is not enough."" Illustrations by Prina Shah.",2020-11-17T00:35:05,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54886125,2020-11-18 08:27:13.054041,BBC,travel,0
Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules?,"Quarantine restrictions apply to people entering the UK from almost every country as coronavirus rates rise again. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, people arriving in the UK from anywhere in Greece, apart from Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos, will have to self-isolate for two weeks. The ban on travellers from Denmark is being extended for another 14 days. But people travelling from Bahrain, Chile, Iceland, Cambodia, Laos, UAE, Qatar, and the Turks and Caicos Islands will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival from Saturday morning. The government is exploring ways to reduce this self-isolation period through testing. People living in England are currently not allowed to travel abroad for a holiday, but can still make work trips. In England, leaving home in order to travel for holidays can be punished by a fine, with penalties starting at Â£200 and going up to Â£6,400. There are currently only a handful of places that travellers from England can visit without encountering restrictions - either when they arrive at their destination, or return.  These include: Many of these destinations require visitors to submit forms several days before departure. Travellers from the common travel area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - are exempt from UK quarantine. However, some parts of the CTA, including Ireland and the Isle of Man, impose restrictions on travellers entering from England. There are separate exemption lists for Wales,Scotland and Northern Ireland. A new taskforce is considering ways that people arriving in the UK may be able to end their 14-day self-isolation early, through a testing system. Transport Minister Grant Shapps told travel association Abta that travellers may be able get tested after about a week of self-isolation or even before they arrive back to the UK. People would have to pay for their own private tests to avoid affecting NHS capacity. The Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) - set up by the government to monitor coronavirus - works with the chief medical officers of each UK nation and advises on where should be on the list.  In the past, the decision appears to have been made when 20 or more people out of every 100,000 in a country, or island, are infected over seven days, but other factors are also considered. These include: The government in England has introduced ''regional travel'' corridors, meaning it may impose separate quarantine rules to a country's mainland that it applies to one or more of its islands.  Almost everyone entering the UK - including British nationals - must fill in a ''passenger locator'' form, regardless of whether or not they need to quarantine.  The form asks travellers to provide their contact details and UK address. If someone who is required to self-isolate does not provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. For 14 days, starting from the day after arrival, people who are quarantining should not: People returning from overseas will not be automatically eligible for statutory sick pay during this period, unless they meet the required conditions - such as displaying coronavirus symptoms. The rules are complicated if you enter a UK nation which doesn't require you to quarantine, but then travel to another part of the UK that does within 14 days. The measures apply to visitors to Scotland ''irrespective of their point of entry into the UK,"" the government says. If you travel to Wales, you will need to isolate for up to 14 days, minus the number of days you have already spent in the UK. You don't have to fill in a new passenger locator form but must update any relevant information, including the address you will be staying at. The government has warned travellers that breaking quarantine rules is a criminal offence, and that they face a fine and potentially a criminal record. Those not self-isolating when they are supposed to can be fined Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, or Â£480 in Scotland. Fines in England for persistent offenders have doubled to Â£10,000. People can be fined up to Â£3,200 in England if they do not provide accurate contact details, or Â£1,920 in Wales.  There is also a fine of Â£100 for not filling in the passenger locator form. One in five eligible passengers will be called or texted to check they are following the rules. You don't need to self-isolate if you drive through a non-exempt country, as long as you don't stop in the country to get out of the car and no-one else gets in. If you are on public transport, you are exempt from quarantine if no new passengers get on while in the non-exempt country and no passenger mixes with people outside or enters a public space at a stop. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease.",2020-11-12T17:11:38,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52544307,2020-11-13 14:39:16.287989,BBC,travel,0
New homes plan revised after Tory backlash,"By Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The government is set to revise its proposals for controversial planning reforms in England, after new housing targets prompted a backlash amongst some senior Conservative MPs  Ministers have proposed updating the formula for where to build houses to meet its aim of delivering more homes. But some said the ""mutant algorithm"" will fail to ""level up"" the North and see the South ""concreted over"". Critics of the proposal include former Prime Minister Theresa May. She said the new formula ""does not guarantee a single extra home being built"". As reported in the Sunday Telegraph, the government is now looking at redesigning the formula so it is ""fairer"".  Revised plans are expected to be announced within weeks.  The new formula was proposed as part of wider government planning reforms. They include a target to build 300,000 new homes across England each year by the mid-2020s, with the formula providing a rough estimate to local councils on how many need to be built in their communities. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said local authorities would then be expected to come forward with potential sites for new buildings - taking into account constraints, such as areas protected by the green belt. But several Tory MPs expressed concern that the government's plan could mean more homes in rural areas and in the South East, rather than the North and Midlands.  While the 300,000 target remains ""undiminished"", it is understood the government has listened to the feedback of critical MPs and ministers are now looking to ""rebalance"" the formula. There is not much detail at this stage, but it is thought the focus will shift towards building more homes in the North and Midlands, and in urban areas or city centres - where the coronavirus pandemic has potentially accelerated a longer-term drop in demand for office and retail spaces.  It does not mean there will not still be new homes built in the South East. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who met Mr Jenrick this week to raise his concerns about the formula, thanked his colleague on Twitter for ""listening to the concerns of me and many other MPs"".  He added: ""We support your desire for more houses to help young people get on the housing ladder and will work with you to make sure a revised algorithm achieves that."" The Tory MP for the Isle of Wight, Bob Seely, who led calls for a change to the plan - and secured a recent Commons debate on the issue - told the BBC he also welcomed the fact the government was willing to listen to the ""strength of feeing and depth of concern"" backbenchers had. But he said they now had to work with MPs and ""rethink"" as the UK needs ""levelling up, not concreting out."" Mr Seely added: ""This is not about MPs objecting to development. It is how development is done sensitively. It is also about how we combine commitments made in our manifesto. ""Concreting over large parts of rural and suburban England, with no democratic right of communities to appeal, as the algorithm and White Paper suggest, will undermine much of the good we are intending to do."" Former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers also said the change in approach from government was ""encouraging"", but ""a few tweaks are not enough"". She said: ""We need radical change to the proposal if we're to ensure that this algorithm doesn't lead to unacceptable overdevelopment.  ""So there's still a long way to go before the government's planning reforms will be acceptable to backbench MPs committed to safeguarding the local environment in their constituencies."" Meanwhile, sources from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government have also confirmed the department is looking to move a ""proportion"" of its operations to the West Midlands, with Wolverhampton understood to be the preferred location.  This would involve moving ministerial offices and senior officials, although ministers would still spend time in Westminster.  Next year has been described as a ""ball park"" timeline for the move.

Dutch police give 'stop paedophile hunts' warning after Arnhem death,"A Dutch police chief has called for an end to ""paedophile hunting"" after a 73-year-old retired teacher was beaten up by teenagers and died of his injuries. Oscar Dros said there was a risk more people could die and he appealed for justice to be left to the authorities. The man from the eastern city of Arnhem was lured into having sexual contact with a minor while in a gay chatroom. Authorities said he was aware the boy was underage. But there was no evidence of past sexual contact with minors. The Arnhem attack is the latest in a series of 250 incidents involving so-called ""paedophile hunters"" in the Netherlands, reports say. Reports say the group of teenagers had come up with the idea of hunting for a paedophile after reading stories elsewhere in the Netherlands. The former teacher arrived at an agreed meeting point on 28 October and was then followed as he made his way home. He was beaten up by a group of boys and died later in hospital. Mayor Ahmed Marcouch has spoken of an ""awful crime"" that has had an impact on the local community. Dozens of neighbours, friends and former pupils took part in a ceremony to remember the victim last weekend. The fifteen-year-old's lawyer told local website De Gelderlander that the idea of hunting paedophiles ""happened out of boredom in this corona time"". His client had got carried away but did not himself take part in the attack. Jamil Roethof argued that the teenagers had only wished to confront the man and had no premeditated plan to attack him. He suggested he had died of a fall. Seven teenagers were arrested, six of them under the age of 18, and two have been held in custody. East Netherlands regional police chief Oscar Dros appealed to Dutch citizens to ""stop paedo-hunting; stop detaining; stop provoking - leave this to us."" Mr Dros told Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that since July some 250 incidents had been registered involving self-styled hunters, and there were probably many more. The practice has now been banned by police and public prosecutors. People had been forced off the road, assaulted, threatened and publicly shamed on the internet, he said. Facebook groups have sprung up across the country, with names like pedohuntnl, and some have attracted thousands of members. One group member told public broadcaster NOS that ""we're doing this to protect children"".  Minutes after going into a chatroom, he claimed, five or six men would try to meet up with you, knowing full well you were a minor. ""That's just not right."" Similar groups have appeared in the UK, prompting one assistant chief constable to say the overall activity of such groups was ""not positive"". The Dutch police chief said such vigilante behaviour ""has no effect, because the evidence these citizens believe they have is often paper thin"". He knew of not one example that had led to a paedophile being convicted.",2020-11-13T11:41:27,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54930488,2020-11-13 14:27:17.772104,BBC,world,0
Coronavirus: How soon can we expect a working vaccine?,"By Dominic BaileyBBC News If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans.  Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful.  There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved.  The UK government, for example, has signed deals for undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries.   In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr MariÃ¢ngela SimÃ£o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check.  ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine plan known as Covax, which aims to raise $2bn (Â£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (Â£24 to Â£28).  AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic.  The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (Â£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups.  After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount.  Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C.  That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them."" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But at present it looks like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would need ultra-cold chain - storage at -80C before being distributed. Welcoming the Pfizer announcement, Dr Richard Hatchett, of Cepi acknowledged that would ""remain a challenge for use in some settings"". ""This is something which will have to be addressed if the vaccine is to be made broadly available,"" he said. But the Ebola vaccine also needed very low temperatures, so it is not impossible. ""To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60Â°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,"" said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. ""Vaccines are not the only solution,"" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. ""You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine. ""Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on.""",2020-11-09T17:12:23,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54027269,2020-11-13 14:47:18.721163,BBC,politics,0
Labour leader Keir Starmer pledges independent complaints process in new year,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to introduce an independent process for dealing with anti-Semitism complaints in the new year. It comes after the party readmitted ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn as a member, following his suspension for suggesting political opponents had dramatically overstated the scale of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn issued a statement saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. But his opponents inside Labour are calling for further action to be taken. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a decision had not yet been taken on whether to restore the Labour whip to Mr Corbyn, which would allow him to sit once more as one of its MPs. A panel of five members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee decided to readmit Mr Corbyn after he had clarified the comments which had led to his suspension, stating that he had not belittled concerns about anti-Semitism. His remarks had been made in response to a damning Equalities and Human Rights Commission report. The former leader's critics have said his case should not have been heard until the party had set up an entirely independent complaints process - as recommended by the human rights watchdog. Following the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir tweeted that it had been a ""painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle anti-Semitism"". He said Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""wrong and completely distracted from a report that identified unlawful conduct in our tackling of racism within the Labour Party"". Sir Keir said he stood by the commitments he made after the report, adding: ""That must mean establishing an independent complaints process as soon as possible in the new year."" He is coming under pressure privately from some of his own MPs - and publicly from the Board of Deputies of British Jews - to take further action. Former Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman, who quit the party over anti-Semitism concerns last year, said the decision was a ""backward step"". ""What Keir Starmer and the chief whip should do now is to refuse to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, in that way they can show that they are determined, as they have said they are, to rid the party of this dreadful stain,"" she told BBC Newsnight. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says he has been told that at least one Jewish MP is considering resigning if Mr Corbyn is welcomed back at Westminster. When Labour acted swiftly and decisively to suspend Jeremy Corbyn, it was seen as a signal the party wanted to distance itself from a toxic period in its recent past. Sir Keir Starmer said he hadn't instigated the action but he supported it. But whatever decision was reached on Tuesday, criticism would have followed. Mr Corbyn didn't apologise for suggesting the scale of anti-Semitism had been overstated by political opponents, which was the reason for his suspension. He simply clarified what he had meant. So reinstating him was bound to attract criticism from those cheered by his suspension. Not to have reinstated him, however, would most likely have fuelled a factional war between those supportive of the Starmer leadership and those - including some union leaders - who remain close to Mr Corbyn. Sir Keir reiterated his commitment to an independent complaints process in the New Year - an Equality and Human Rights Commission recommendation. But putting Labour under fresh leadership hasn't silenced or banished those still supportive of the old leadership. And the line Sir Keir wants to draw under the anti-Semitism rows hasn't been fully drawn. In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who is currently an independent MP - said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and that he regretted the ""pain"" caused. His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" It is not yet clear whether Mr Corbyn will face further sanctions from the party. Its general secretary, David Evans, took the decision to suspend him in October, although Sir Keir endorsed it. The ECHR's report found Labour had breached the Equalities Act over its handling of complaints of anti-Semitism during Mr Corbyn's time in charge. Labour said Mr Corbyn had been suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Following his readmission, the Islington North MP said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government."" But the Jewish Labour Movement called the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn ""extraordinary"", adding: ""After his failure of leadership to tackle anti-Semitism, so clearly set out in the EHRC's report, any reasonable and fair-minded observer would see Jeremy Corbyn's statement today as insincere and wholly inadequate."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""What message does this send? Zero tolerance either means zero tolerance or it's meaningless."" The co-chairman of the Conservative Party, MP Amanda Milling, has written to Sir Keir, saying: ""You have claimed that Labour is 'under new leadership', but now is the moment to prove it - Mr Corbyn should be expelled permanently."" However, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Mr Corbyn, called the reinstatement a ""correct, fair and unifying decision"". He said Labour had to ""move forward"" in implementing the EHRC's recommendations and ""redouble our efforts to inspire voters"" about Sir Keir's policies, acting as a ""unified and strong"" party. And Jenny Manson, co-chairman of pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour, told BBC Newsnight that ""an awful lot of us are very happy he (Mr Corbyn) is back in the party"" and would be ""very sad indeed"" if the whip is taken away from him.",2020-11-18T02:13:38,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54982626,2020-11-18 08:17:58.430095,BBC,politics,0
The small shops in battle with the retail giants,"By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter When Boris Johnson came on television to announce the November lockdown, it was the final straw for Joh Rindom.  Before the prime minister had even finished speaking, the shop owner from Bristol had hammered out her response on Instagram. ""Small businesses will once again suffer immeasurably,"" she told her customers.  ""So PLEASE shop small,"" she added. ""Resist Amazon at all costs, and think about how you 'vote with your money'."" Joh runs That Thing, an independent fashion, homeware and accessories shop. Like many smaller retailers she's just been through the hardest year she's ever known. It is always hard to compete with the big online brands but this year, shop-owners like her have had to stand by as rival outlets - deemed essential - remain open, scooping up Christmas trade.  By the end of November non-essential shops will have been closed for 17 weeks of the year. Some say it's a ""use it or lose it"" situation: shoppers need to support them or next Christmas they won't be there. ""Small businesses have websites too,"" says Joh. ""People just need to wake up a bit and think outside that box."" Perhaps because people have spent more time at home, perhaps because they've focused on what is important to them, this year there does seem to be a ""fashion for independents"", she thinks. A third of us plan to spend more at independent stores this year than we did in 2019, according to a poll commissioned by Enterprise Nation, an organisation which supports start-ups. It found younger shoppers are even more determined, with half of under-35s planning to shop more at independents. Small scale sellers have been quick to respond to these pledges, offering everything from vintage handbags to macrame plant hangers. There are more than 42 million posts tagged #shoplocal on Instagram. Larger independents are showing their agility too. Those who weren't already trading online have been quick to remedy that, and while their budgets make it hard to compete with the likes of John Lewis and Marks and Spencer, they're finding ways to gain traction: reaching out to local online community groups, tapping into nostalgia with ""Hovis-ad style"" bicycle deliveries, and emphasising their environmental credentials. Others are innovating even more: chatting one-to-one with customers on video calls and offering personal shopping over Zoom.  Loki Wine Merchants in Birmingham has held virtual wine tastings, and DJV Boutique in Ipswich launched online fashion shows and a service that helps select, wrap and send your gifts for you. DJV's owner Mandy Errington says loyal customers are keen to support them but it doesn't stop there. ""We're attracting new people because of the personal services,"" she says.  But independents know that still won't be enough to get them noticed in the run up to Christmas, so some are joining forces. In Bristol Joh Rindom has banded together with 22 other independent outlets to create an online directory. They are putting posters up around the city advertising ""Bristol Independents Online"" with a QR code linking to their website.  Christmas markets, which usually see the streets of many UK towns and cities crammed with shoppers elbow-to-elbow, have inevitably been cancelled. But many of those are being replaced with virtual forums, offering the chance to buy direct from the people who would usually run stalls. More permanently, Bookshop.org has recently launched in the UK. Marketing themselves as an ""ethical"" way to fight the might of Amazon, it's hosting online shopfronts for more than 250 of the UK's independent booksellers, offering them a large slice of any sales revenue they help generate. For its part, Amazon points out it is not the enemy to small businesses that it is sometimes painted. More than half of the physical products sold on Amazon come from small and medium-sized third party businesses, it says.  In October it held a small business promotion to drive business their way and it runs bootcamps and online learning sessions to support small sellers in conjunction with Enterprise Nation. Emma Jones, the founder of Enterprise Nation, says Amazon and similar forums can help to build a ""broad exposure to customers"". ""Yes, have your own e-commerce website and social channels, but it also makes sense to try out selling on Amazon, Etsy or Uber Eats for restaurants and caterers, as they offer access to a vast customer network,"" she says. Lavinia Davolio, founder of confectionary boutique Lavolio in London, says before Covid-19 hit around half of her sales were online, the majority of them through Amazon. But this year those sales have doubled. Amazon has been ""a lifesaver"" she says.  So will these strategies be enough to see local retailers through? Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, a partner in Deloitte's retail consulting practice, says strategies like these - building networks, innovating with digital technology, reaching out to new customers - could make all the difference.  ""The businesses that are proactive about trying different things - testing, learning, failing as quickly as possible - they're the ones who have the best chance of thriving,"" he says. What's more they'll then be in a stronger position to compete in future years. But in the end, says Andrew Goodacre from the British Independent Retailers Association, it will come down to consumers. Will they put their money where their mouths are? ""It will only be enough if people don't panic and buy everything [for Christmas] now,"" he says.  ""There are two things I'd urge consumers to do: wait until December, you'll have better choice and better value. And if you are shopping online, look for the shop you know, not the product you want.""",2020-11-13T22:53:19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54873418,2020-11-14 11:08:40.831137,BBC,technology,0
Senior jobs with flexible hours 'get 20% more female applicants',"Women are 20% more likely to apply for senior roles if they offer flexible hours, a government-backed study for Zurich insurance suggests.     Using gender-neutral language in job adverts also generated ""significant change"", it found.   It comes after Zurich, which employs 4,500 in the UK, began advertising part-time, job share or flexible options in all job vacancies last year. As a result it said the number of women hired for top roles had risen by 33%.  The research - which was carried out by the Behavioural Insights Team, a government-backed think tank - found women have struggled to progress in their careers at Zurich in the past.  It found there had been a lack of applications from women for senior roles, many of which had not been available on a flexible basis.  Female employees reported this had made them less likely to apply.  ""We've seen hugely encouraging results, simply by adding six words to our job adverts [offering flexible working arrangements],"" said Steve Collinson, Zurich's head of HR. ""By offering roles that fit flexibly around family life, employers could open the floodgates to a much wider pool of untapped talent. ""This will also help women progress into higher paid jobs whilst fitting other commitments around their careers,"" he added. According to the research, women are more likely to have caring responsibilities and may struggle to progress into more senior roles if they do not offer flexible working options. Some even end up leaving the labour market.  The study, which looked at Zurich job vacancies between March 2019 and February 2020, found many more men also applied for roles when they offered flexible working options, suggesting the issue was ""just as important"" for them. Existing part-time employees also reported a stronger sense of ""belonging"" due to the shift, pointing to the fear some workers have of being judged for not working full-time. Minister for Women Baroness Berridge said: ""The benefits of flexible working have really been emphasised during recent months.  ""We want to see more employers embracing practices such as working from home and returners programmes, which can have a positive impact for both men and women.""

Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in your area?,"There have been more than 1.2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and 50,000 people have died, government figures show.  However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:

This was the highest figure in since the start of the pandemic, though it's thought there were more infections during the first peak in the spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases. Confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October. There are some signs, however, of that growth slowing a little since the start of November. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is tracking Covid-19 in the community, also suggest the increase in new infections may be stabilising.  Approximately one in 90 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 31 October, according to the ONS figures.  In Scotland and Wales, about one in 110 people had the virus. One in 75, about 25,000 people, had the virus in Northern Ireland.  Deaths have been rising again since the beginning of September following their first peak in April. On Thursday, the government reported 563 new deaths. In England, there were 469 new deaths. Scotland reported 45 and there were 34 new deaths in Wales and 15 in Northern Ireland. Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included. England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been nearly 45,000.   Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.  The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions in recent weeks.  But some areas - including the North West, London, Scotland and Northern Ireland - are beginning to see signs of a slight improvement.  Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The orange areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.

         Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in recent weeks.  In England, a four-week lockdown began on 5 November - replacing the three-tier system until 2 December. Northern Ireland introduced additional restrictions last month, which were due to end on Saturday, 14 November. But they have been extended for another week, with a partial reopening of some sectors on 20 November. In Scotland, there is now a five-tier system of virus alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country. In Wales, a two-week 'firebreak' lockdown which began in the last week of October has now ended but some restrictions are still in place.  When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways. Government figures count people who tested positive for coronavirus and died within 28 days. But there are two other measures.  The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 60,000 deaths by 23 October. The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the final week of October, which show there were 12,501 deaths registered in the UK. Some 1,597 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - up from 1,126 the week before.  Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.  The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.  If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.  The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 1.1 to 1.3. The estimate for England is 1.1 to 1.3, while for Scotland it is 0.9 to 1.1. The estimate for Wales is 1.0 to 1.3 and in Northern Ireland it is a little above 0.7. The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.",2020-11-13T09:47:08,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,2020-11-13 14:40:57.116947,BBC,world,0
I'm A Celebrity: Ant and Dec launch new series from Welsh castle,"Ant and Dec told campmates ""things are going to be a bit different this year"" as the latest series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here launched on Sunday. This year's series is taking place in Gwrych Castle in North Wales instead of the Australian jungle due to Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Mo Farah, Vernon Kay and Beverley Callard are among the new campmates. ""I can't tell you how excited we are to see you all here together finally,"" said Dec. ""Welcome to the castle."" ""Things are going to be a bit different this year,"" continued Ant. ""There's no jungle obviously, there's no dunny, there's a privy [toilet] and I can guarantee you there's absolutely no chance of sunbathing."" Dec added: ""Some things will stay exactly the same. Some things will be reassuringly familiar. So you will live on a diet of rice and beans and you'll do trials to win food for the camp."" The other campmates this series include former EastEnders star Shane Richie, Paralympic champion Hollie Arnold, and journalist Victoria Derbyshire. Actress Jessica Plummer, Radio 1 DJ Jordan North, podcaster Giovanna Fletcher and former Strictly pro dancer AJ Pritchard complete the line-up. The episode opened with the 10 celebrities split into two groups of five, with one group meeting at the top of a cliff and the other at the bottom.  Those at the top then had to start abseiling down the cliff to collect the team's rucksacks, which were padlocked half way down the cliff side. North was so nervous about the challenge he was sick before it began. ""I've only been here 5 minutes and I'm puking up already,"" he said. Me emerging from Lockdown 2.0 #ImACeleb pic.twitter.com/imERHxD7e9 Later in the episode, the 10 celebrities were told they would all take part in the first trial of the series, titled The Gates To Hell. The challenge saw each of the campmates locked in 10 adjacent chambers. The team then had to pass gold stars, each worth a meal for the camp, from one end to the other - while having cockroaches, maggots and crickets dropped on them.  The group managed to move seven of the 10 gold stars to the end of the line. Derbyshire said she felt ""ecstatic that we got so many stars and that it's all over"", but North described the experience as ""absolutely horrific"". After the challenge was over, Callard discovered there were still critters in her pockets and said: ""Oh my god this is my worst nightmare!"" The campmates were also seen exploring their new home, with several of them less than impressed by the castle's washroom. ""Its minging, it needs a really good clean. Well I'm sorry but no. My hair. I will look like I've had Donald Trump's hairdresser,"" joked Callard. Reflecting on the new location, Kay said: ""There are certain things that Australia would've provided that Wales doesn't - a tan, and the opportunity to wear budgie smugglers."" On social media, viewers enjoyed poking fun at the latest round of celebrities and their reactions to the first challenges. Several Twitter users made light of Arnold introducing herself as ""Hollie Arnold MBE"" when she met her fellow campmates. Others enjoyed Plummer's struggle to remember where her group Neon Jungle's single had charted, confusing the Scottish singles chart with the overall UK chart. Giovanna Fletcher's husband Tom, from the band McFly, got particularly nervous watching the opening challenge, tweeting: ""Did Shane Richie just drop my wife off a cliff?!"" Whoâs getting voted to do the most Bushtucker trials this year? ð #imacelebrity #ImACeleb pic.twitter.com/qiQTZmX9XM The new setting broadly went down well with viewers, with TV critic Emma Bullimore writing: ""Wales looks gorgeous, it's a great group of celebs and Ant and Dec are on good form. I'd be happy for them never to go back to Australia."" Radio 1 DJ Greg James agreed: ""I think it's gonna be better in Wales and won't ever go back to Australia."" North's reaction to the first challenge led several viewers to suggest the public would inevitably vote for him to do the majority of the trials this series. And, sure enough, the episode concluded with North and Richie finding out they would face the next bushtucker trial. This series will run for three weeks, with one winner ultimately being crowned the king or queen of the castle - instead of jungle. By Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter It took a minute to acclimatise to I'm A Celebrity's new look as Ant and Dec welcomed viewers to North Wales, but it wasn't long before it began feeling like business as usual. Just like Love Island's move from Spain to South Africa for its winter series, the location might be different, but it fundamentally remains the same show with the same basic format underneath. All the usual I'm A Celebrity building blocks are in place - it's already clear there will still be exhausted and terrified celebrities doing bushtucker trials while Ant and Dec hold the show together (and try not to laugh at them too much).  Clocking on with a difference tonight! â± #imaceleb in one hour! ð´ó §ó ¢ó ·ó ¬ó ³ó ¿ð¦ðº pic.twitter.com/tHNnsjsMk3 This year's line-up is strong and the group supported each other well during the first challenge, with Ant telling them they ""worked well as a team"". This could end up being one of the most successful series of I'm A Celebrity yet for ITV. The current lockdown restrictions have resulted in a major ratings boost for programmes like Strictly Come Dancing as people stay at home. The weather might be worse than in Australia, but there are a few big bonuses about being in the UK for this year's celebrities. Not only have they avoided jet lag, but staying in the UK's time zone will mean they won't have to get up at the crack of dawn for the live evictions.  So, every cloud.

Fact-checking the US and China on climate and environment,"By Reality Check team and BBC MonitoringBBC News There is tension between the China and the US on a range of issues, including climate change and the environment. In September, the US issued a list of China's environmental ""abuses."" In response, China put out its own report, detailing US ""environmental damage"". China claims cumulative CO2 emissions from the US are about three times those of China. From 1750 (when emissions are thought to have been virtually zero) until the end of 2018, China produced about 210.20 billion tonnes of CO2, according to Our World in Data, which compiles statistics from different countries.  The US produced  404.77 billion tonnes in the same period.  And in recent years, US carbon emissions have been on a downward trend - as it moves away from coal towards natural gas and renewable energy. The US claims China's total energy-related emissions are twice those of the US and nearly one-third of all emissions globally. China's annual emissions today are about double those of the US, according to UN data. And last year, China accounted for about one-third of global CO2 emissions while the US produced 13%. China claims illegal logging and deforestation are ""rampant"" in the US.  But the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says illegal logging is not ""widespread"" in the US.  And neither is the US among the top-10 countries for average annual loss of forest area between 2010 and 2020, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. But as the world's largest end-user of wood, US demand for tropical timber could be partly driving a high rate of illegal logging in other parts of the world, according to the WWF. In 2008, the US tightened up laws on importing products made from illegally logged wood. And one 2015 study said since then, there had been a ""substantial decline"" in illegally sourced imports. But it added large volumes of wood continued to be imported from ""likely illegal sources"". And in 2019, the US-based Environmental Investigation Agency reported illegally sourced timber from West Africa was still being found in wood products sold in the US. The US claims: ""China is the world's largest consumer of illegal timber products."" And, according to studies, that is true. The Environmental Investigation Agency says: ""The immense scale of China's sourcing [of wood] from high-risk regions [of the world] means that a significant proportion of its timber and wood product imports were illegally harvested.""  And research by Global Witness last year said there were ""worrying"" levels of illegality in countries from which China sources more than 80% of its timber. In December 2019, China tightened up its laws to ban Chinese companies from trading in ""illegally sourced timber"". But it is not yet clear what impact this might have had on illegally felled timber sourced from abroad. China claims: ""The US is the world's largest exporter of solid waste and a major consumer of plastic in per capita terms."" Plastic is a major component of solid waste. And the US shipped 662,244 tonnes of it to other countries in 2019.   But Japan and Germany shipped more in terms of value that year, according to UN data. And US exports of plastic waste have come down since 2018, mainly because some countries, including China, have restricted imports. The US claims ""China is the biggest producer and exporter of plastic products"" and the largest contributor to marine plastic debris. The World Bank confirms China is the world's biggest producer of plastic items, estimated at a third of the world's total. But that is largely due to the sheer volume of goods China produces and exports overall. And a study published this year, using the latest data, from 2016, shows the US and other countries still produce more per capita waste plastic. ""The US is 4% of the world's population, yet it produces 17% of its plastic waste,"" it says. But China, and other countries in Asia, are major contributors to marine plastic waste.  About 80% of plastics in the ocean come from land-based sources. And China's Yangtze river in China is believed to be the top source, along with rivers in other parts of Asia. Last year, China's Environment Ministry reported a 27% rise in the amount of plastic waste found in its coastal waters in 2018. On average, 24kg (53lb) of waste was found floating in every 1,000 sq m (11,000 sq ft) of water. And more than 88% of this was plastic.

UK climate plan: What do the terms mean?,"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The UK prime minister is set to publish his long-awaited ""net zero"" plan to tackle climate change. He has already backed technologies like carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and small reactors. Here, we break down some of the terms we're likely to hear about in the plan. The world is over-heating fast, thanks to emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases from burning fossil fuels. Another important human-produced heating gas is methane â mostly from farming and landfill. Scientists warn it simply wonât be possible to get emissions of these to zero by the UK's chosen date of 2050. So instead, the government is aiming for a target known as net zero. That means the emissions that canât be avoided by clean technology in 2050 will either be buried using the technology of carbon capture and storage, or soaked up by plants and soils. Here, we explain some of these clean energy technologies. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) This does what it says on the tin â a technology that employs a chemical process to capture CO2 emissions from industrial chimneys. The gas is then compressed and forced into porous underground rocks.  Two decades ago, it was touted as a climate saviour. But it's very expensive and has never really taken off.  New technologies can also take waste CO2 and turn it into useful chemicals â but demand is vastly outstripped by the supply of unwanted CO2. Net zero vs carbon neutral Let's take net zero first. It refers to balancing out any greenhouse gas emissions produced by industry, transport or other sources by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. This usually occurs through, for example, planting trees, which sequester carbon in the ground. The terms net zero and carbon neutral are often seen as interchangeable. But while net zero usually refers to all greenhouse gases, Chris Stark, chief executive of the UK government's advisory body the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), said his organisation mostly uses carbon neutral when referring to carbon dioxide emissions only. Jim Watson, professor of energy policy at University College London (UCL), concurred with the CCC's definition but he added that it was ""unfortunate"" there was no universally agreed definition for the terms.  Small modular reactors (SMRs) Mr Johnson wants new nuclear power for the UK but history has shown that the construction of large nuclear power plants often goes way over schedule and budget.  Several manufacturers are now trying to develop small modular plants as a âkit of partsâ that can be assembled on site. The idea is that factory-built modules will be constructed at scale to drive down costs but some experts are highly sceptical. Hydrogen power Hydrogen is the lightest element on Earth. When itâs used as a source of energy, it produces no direct carbon emissions.  It can be used either in fuel cells, or burned in internal combustion engines. Several industries hope hydrogen will replace the natural gas they burn and some transport experts believe hydrogen fuel cells will increasingly be used to power vehicles. A fuel cell is an ingenious piece of equipment that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. This can be used, say, to power a lorry. Many fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity - with water and heat as by-products.  A key question is whether the hydrogen used for energy is itself from fossil gas. A key process for producing hydrogen in this way, known as steam reforming, also emits troublesome carbon dioxide and is expensive.  Hydrogen can also be manufactured by âsplittingâ water using wind energy, which is clean but even more costly. Nuclear fusion Conventional nuclear power stations rely on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. But nuclear fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one.  It's an attempt to replicate the processes of the Sun here on Earth. Nuclear fusion has been a dream of scientists for decades, because, like the Sun, it could act as an almost limitless source of energy. Further attractions include cheap fuel, relatively little radioactive waste and no emissions of greenhouse gases. But getting more energy out than you put in remains immensely challenging and, since the 1950s, it's been touted as being ""30 years away"". COP meetings This time next year â postponed from 2020 because of Covid-19 â the UK will host a crucial meeting of world leaders known as COP26. Itâs where delegates from nations across the globe agree what they're going to do hold back climate change. COP stands for Conference of the Parties.  It will be attended by countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - back in 1992. This year's meeting will be the 26th, which is why it's called COP26. NDCs Next month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will convene a virtual summit where leaders will be asked to offer their NDCs for tackling climate change. NDCs are Nationally Determined Contributions - in other words, voluntary offers by nations to cut their own emissions.  The timeframe in focus is up to 2030, and if the UK wants to encourage other countries to make cuts that are equal to the challenge, Mr Johnson must make an ambitious pledge with far-reaching effects across the economy.  Carbon budgets This is a restriction that's placed on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted over a set period of time. The UK uses carbon budgets to keep on track with its strategy of switching over to a low-carbon economy. The next budget, to be set next month, will carry Britain through to 2037, by which time it should be on track for net zero in 2050.

How North Korea is trying to tackle smoking,"By Upasana BhatBBC Monitoring How does a country like North Korea tackle one of the world's highest smoking rates when its leader sends the wrong message by constantly lighting up in public? There have been a number of campaigns against smoking in the country, where nearly half of all men but no women smoke, according to data from the World Health Organization. A law passed earlier this month specified a ban on smoking in public places in North Korea and set out rules to provide a ""more cultured and hygienic"" environment for the people. But state media often show Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un with a cigarette in hand, setting a bad example. So what exactly do the country's anti-smoking measures achieve?  The Tobacco Prohibition Law adopted in early November sets out rules that all institutions, organisations and citizens ""must follow in protecting the lives and health of the people"".  The law tightens the ""legal and social controls on the production and sale of cigarettes and on smoking as required by the state tobacco-prohibition policy"". It also mentions places where smoking is banned, such as areas meant for ""political and ideological education"", theatres and cinemas, education units, public health facilities and public transport. There's  talk of penalties, but state media haven't said what they are.  Days after passing the new law, state news agency KCNA reported that smokers could be at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, citing ""doctors and experts around the world"". North Korea's anti-smoking drives became a regular occurrence after it became a signatory to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which it ratified in 2005.  As part of the country's Tobacco Control Law, warning labels were put on cigarette packaging and restrictions put in place on smoking in public areas. A ""brisk"" campaign took place in 2019 to inform smokers about the ""harmfulness"" of the practice, KCNA reported. State media also said steps had been taken to restrict the import of foreign-made tobacco. Korean Central Television has described  those who smoke in the morning and evening as ""unconscionable"" people, Seoul-based The Daily NK website reported.  This year, a website giving information about the dangers of smoking was launched. ""Science and information are important in anti-smoking campaigns,"" propaganda outlet Arirang-Meari said. But Kim Jong-un is a heavy smoker, often spotted with a cigarette during his visits - whether it's to a children's camp or while supervising a missile test. In February 2019, he was filmed smoking during a break en route a train journey to Vietnam for his second summit with US President Donald Trump. His sister Kim Yo-jong held an ashtray for him.  Kim's wife Ri Sol-ju is said to have urged him to quit, but he ""doesn't listen"", some media outlets have reported.  Smoking rates have been high in North Korea for years, and remain so - although they do appear to be coming down very slowly.  A WHO report for 2019 says that 46.1% of all men above the age of 15 in the country smoke.  According to the data, no women smoke. That's probably because women are looked down on for smoking in North Korean society. ""It is both culturally and socially taboo for women to smoke in public, especially younger women, even in comparison to South Korea. In North Korea, some married or elderly women smoke in private,"" James Banfill, director of CoreanaConnect, a US-based NGO working in North Korea, told BBC Monitoring.  ""Smoking in North Korea  has been and is defined by male consumers. Smoking has roles in North Korean male social, work and military culture. Excess tobacco consumption and addiction are culturally acceptable for men,"" according to Min Chao Choy, a journalist with specialist website NK News. In fact, women are used in state campaigns to discourage men from smoking. State TV once aired a  programme titled ""The Extra Quality Favourite Item Threatening Life"" in which women scolded male smokers, calling them ""imbeciles who upset their surroundings"". Regardless of the cultural  context and gender equations, smoking kills large numbers in the North. Each year, over 71,300 people die in North Korea due to diseases caused by tobacco use, according to data collected by Tobacco Atlas. In comparison, Australia  - a country with a similar population at just over 25 million people - has 22,200 deaths annually due to tobacco use. Some health experts feel the initiatives are making an impact. ""Less  than half of adult males or 46.1% are smokers: this is down from 52.3% in 2009. Over the last more than 20 visits over 13 years to North Korea, I am seeing fewer smokers in Pyongyang, especially in the younger males,"" Kee B Park, director of the Korea Health Policy Project at Harvard Medical School, told BBC Monitoring. But there seems to be  mixed messaging as cigarettes are easily available and affordable in North Korea. ""Like many nations, North Korea strives towards its own concept of modernity, which includes some modern health policies like smoking cessation. The difference between the regime's aspirations and what occurs in reality is often vast, and that divide can be seen in the country's smoking policies versus its thriving smoking culture,"" Min Chao Choy says. And some analysts feel that stronger deterrents are needed to get people to kick the habit. ""Anti-smoking campaigns are probably aimed at reducing smoking in specific places. Other than sheer willpower, there aren't many mechanisms to help a person quit in North Korea,"" Mr Banfill says.  But imagine what a powerful message it would be if the leader set a better example and decided to quit? Of course there's no knowing when or if that might ever happen.",2020-11-14T00:06:58,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54901073,2020-11-14 11:12:54.452810,BBC,world,0
Michigan's largest county certifies election results after Republicans earlier blocked certification,"A bipartisan panel in Michigan's largest county unanimously certified its presidential results on Tuesday night, a stunning reversal hours after Republicans had temporarily blocked certification based on dubious claims of voting irregularities in Detroit.The Wayne County Board of Canvassers initially deadlocked 2-2 on whether to certify the results, with two Democrats voting to certify and two Republicans voting against it, citing concerns of examples where Detroit precincts found discrepancies during their post-election review process. That vote was immediately condemned by Democratic officials and nonpartisan experts, who said the election in Detroit had been conducted cleanly.RELATED: CNN's live presidential election resultsPresident-elect Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 148,000 votes, a victory made possible by a strong showing in Wayne County, where he netted more than 322,000 votes over President Donald Trump.The initial vote against certification drew the attention of the President, who posted a series of tweets praising the GOP members of the canvassing board for ""having courage."" He also spread false claims about massive voter fraud and said officials in the state should ""flip Michigan back to TRUMP.""Trump White HouseUS military anticipates Trump will issue order to plan for further troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and IraqTop Trump adviser moves closer to accepting Biden win: 'Obviously, things look that way now'Trump aims to undermine Biden's legitimacy even as legal challenges fizzleMAP: Full election resultsRead MoreTrump has mounted a long-shot attempt to overturn the election results through lawsuits and the Electoral College -- and one of the Trump campaign's legal advisers said the initial refusal to certify the results should open the door for the ""Republican state legislator (sic) will select the electors."" GOP lawmakers in Michigan have repeatedly said they'll respect the statewide popular vote and won't intervene in the process.  When announcing their decision to certify the results, the board also called on Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to do a comprehensive audit on the precincts in Detroit that had found discrepancies during their post-election review. In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" Benson said she would conduct that audit, and she praised the decision by the county board to reverse itself and certify the results.""It appears that the truth won in this scenario,"" she said. ""Basically, the evidence was clear: There were no irregularities, there was no evidence of widespread fraud and in fact there were simply minor clerical errors. ... I think they did the right thing, they performed their duty and they certified the election for the voters in Wayne County."" Abrupt reversalEven after the initial party-line deadlock, experts were skeptical that the results from Wayne County would ultimately be excluded from the statewide count. That would have put Biden's Michigan victory in jeopardy -- but CNN has projected that he will win 306 electoral votes, which means he'd still become the next president even in the unlikely scenario that he doesn't get Michigan's 16 electoral votes.During the meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, Vice Chair Jonathan Kinloch called the earlier deadlock ""reckless and irresponsible."" Kinloch is one of the two Democrats on the panel.""This board, over the years, has taken pride in not allowing politics to show itself in the actions of what we do,"" Kinloch said. ""There is no reason under the sun for us to not certify this election. I believe politics made its presence here today, and I think forever that this board will have to live with the fact that we have allowed external, non-relevant issues to impact this decision today, hoping to change and bring about an outcome that will not happen.""The Republican chair of the board, Monica Palmer, explained why she had earlier voted against certification.""Based on what I saw and went through in poll books in this canvas, I believe that we do not have complete and accurate information in those poll books,"" Palmer said.At one point, Palmer suggested that the board certify the rest of the county's results, aside from Detroit, which was not pursued by the board.""I would be open to a motion to certify communities other than the city of Detroit"" Palmer said, referring to other parts of Wayne County.When the meeting opened up for public comments, Wayne County citizens lined up to voice their frustration over the board's initial decision to delay the certification of results for hours.Rev. Wendell Anthony, the head of the Detroit branch of the NAACP, harshly criticized Palmer's suggestion to exclude Detroit from the county's certification of results.""You have extracted a Black city out of a county and said the only one that I have fault against is the city of Detroit, where 80% of the people who reside here are African Americans. Shame on you,"" Anthony said. ""Shame on you for leading to this level of corruption. You have disavowed your right to even sit in the seat that you occupy. You are a disgrace as it relates to the ability to have a free and impartial election in this nation.""Edith Lee-Payne, who worked as a supervisor of poll workers at the TCF Center in Detroit where the city's absentee ballots were counted, laid out the step-by-step process of how absentee ballots were counted, hoping to discredit any suggestions of fraud.She shared that at one point a Republican poll challenger approached her in a way that made her afraid for her life. To put into perspective how hurtful the delay in certification was to her, Lee-Payne reflected on joining the march on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King when she was 12 years old.""I marched with Dr. King. I take that with pride, I say that with pride"" Payne said. ""What you're doing to all of the people in the city of Detroit, people in Wayne County, and to me -- because I really have to take this personal -- is, I really have no words for it."" An Air Force veteran and University of Michigan law student, who was a nonpartisan observer at the TCF Center on November 4, grew emotional when saying the board's decision diminished the rights he sought to defend.""As someone who served in the military, I was willing to sacrifice my life so that every single American would have the right to vote. I thought that was something that we all believed in as Americans. It breaks my heart to see that some of my fellow Americans seem to disagree,"" Joseph Zimmerman said.In a written statement after the initial deadlock, Benson said it was ""common"" for some precincts to have minor discrepancies with their poll books. But she also said, ""Importantly, this is not an indication that any votes were improperly cast or counted."" Election experts and Michigan insiders reacted with shock to the original vote.""The people have spoken: Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 140,000 votes,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""Today's action is a blatant attempt to undermine the will of the voters. The process, however, will move forward. Under Michigan law, the Board of State of Canvassers will now finish the job and I have every expectation they will certify the results when the job is done.""Nancy Kaffer, a columnist at the Detroit Free Press, tweeted, ""This is unprecedented in my 20 years covering government here."" Amy Walter of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report tweeted, ""There has been zero evidence of fraud here or elsewhere"" and said Republican efforts to block certification ""does real and lasting damage to our institutions.""The GOP-led Michigan Senate voted in September in support of resolution confirming that the state's electors should be faithful to voting for the presidential candidate as certified by Michigan's election officials, Amber McCann, deputy chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, confirmed to CNN.

Supermarket in China apologizes for chart that labels women who wear larger sizes 'rotten' and 'terrible',"A supermarket chain in China has apologized for apparently featuring a chart in one of its stores that used disparaging language to refer to women who wear larger-sized clothes as ""rotten"" and ""terrible.""A photo of the sign, which appeared in an RT-Mart store, went viral this week on Chinese social media, where posts about it on the Twitter-like platform Weibo racked up more than four million views. The sign was labeled as a ""suggested women's sizing chart,"" and laid out the different heights and weights associated with clothing sizes. Each size also included an adjective used to describe it: Small sizes were ""skinny"" and medium sizes were ""beautiful,"" while large sizes were ""rotten"" or ""terrible"" and XXL sizes were ""extremely terrible.""The sizing guide was intended for women between ages 18 and 35, according to the sign. CNN Business has not independently verified the photo and it isn't clear which store featured the controversial sizing chart. However, RT-Mart on Thursday ""deeply"" apologized for the incident in a statement posted to its Weibo account.Read More""After the incident, RT-Mart thoroughly inspected all RT-Mart stores immediately,"" the company said. ""After investigation, it was confirmed that such an incident occurred in one store, and the headquarters has quickly requested the store to remove all signs.""The controversy has reignited criticisms of widespread sexism in Chinese society, particularly around the pressure exerted on women to look a certain way.Chinese President Xi Jinping last month called for greater gender equality in a speech to the United Nations and a government spokesman quoted an oft-repeated saying ""women hold up half the sky"" to highlight China's commitment to the cause when asked about this issue early this week.The incident also comes as the Chinese government is pushing an anti-food waste campaign countrywide in an attempt to ensure food security for the nation's almost 1.4 billion people. To encourage people to eat less, restaurants have been accused of fat-shaming behaviors, including weighing customers before they eat and then recommending meals based on their results.One Weibo user said that the existence of the sign was an indictment of a broader culture of discrimination towards women inside the company.""As long as there was one staff member questioning this, it would have been impossible to put it out,"" the commenter said. Another said that whoever had written that larger women were ""rotten"" had a ""rotten mind.""China Women's News, which is operated by the Communist Party-affiliated All China Women's Federation, said on its official Weibo that the chart was ""detestable.""""Don't lose respect to grab attention. Advertising and marketing should reflect the corporate values and cultural image. A responsible company should not conduct marketing this way. Learn the lesson!"" the group said.RT-Mart is headquartered in Taiwan but has 416 supermarkets in mainland China. It said that it would strengthen its internal management to ensure similar incidents don't occur in the future.-- CNN's Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",2020-11-13T08:48:34Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/business/china-department-store-clothing-size-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-16 11:02:08.122976,CNN,world,0
Trump's transition sabotage threatens Covid-19 vaccine rollout,"President Donald Trump's refusal to coordinate with President-elect Joe Biden on the critical Covid-19 vaccine is bringing a staggering possibility into clearer view: that an outgoing US commander in chief is actively working to sabotage his successor.Trump's denial of his election defeat, his lies about nonexistent mass coordinated voter fraud and his strangling of the rituals of transferring power between administrations are not just democracy-damaging aberrations.Given the current national emergency, they threaten to cause practical fallout that could damage Biden's incoming White House not just in a political sense. There are increasing concerns that Trump's obstruction will slow and complicate the delivery of the vaccine that brings the tantalizing prospect of a return to normal life amid stunning news from trials showing doses are effective in stopping more than 90% of coronavirus infections.CNN's 2020 election resultsThe distribution operation will be a massively complex and historic public vaccination effort targeting hundreds of millions of Americans -- many millions of whom have resisted following basic safety protocols like wearing masks because Trump has encouraged them not to. The inoculation campaign will require a high level of public trust and will involve sharp ethical debates among officials about who should get the vaccine first. The entire program could be damaged if it is politicized. But unless something changes, the Biden team may face the task of tackling those issues afresh, in a frantic catch-up operation. Read MoreIt's not just on the vaccine where Trump is threatening the success of the next administration. Attacks by the President and aides on governors stepping into his leadership vacuum as the pandemic rips across all 50 states mean the situation Biden will inherit will be worse than it needed to be.The victims of this neglect will be thousands of Americans whom health experts expect to die or get sick in the absence of a coordinated national response to the winter spike in infections and workers caught up in new restrictions imposed on business by local leaders trying to get the virus under control -- as well as the millions of schoolchildren who are already falling behind while classrooms remain shuttered.""More people may die if we don't coordinate,"" Biden warned bluntly on Monday, stepping up his pressure for Trump to recognize his defeat in the election and impending exit from office.Unlike Trump, who is wallowing in his sense of personal grievance and fury at what he sees as a humiliating loss, Biden does have a sense of urgency and new proposals, and he is calling for a coordinated national effort to mitigate the harrowing impact of the nationwide spike in infections. But while he has the moral standing of an election win, he has no power to implement his plans until Inauguration Day on January 20.CNN reported on Monday that Trump has no intention of abandoning his false attacks on the election to initiate an orderly transition process or to accept that Biden is the rightful next president.Instead, his legal challenges, which have made little headway in the courts, seem expressly aimed at boosting conspiracy theories among his supporters and preserving his hold on the Republican Party, and ultimately to cast Biden's tenure as illegitimate. The failure of many GOP leaders in Washington, who remain hostage to Trump's political base, to unequivocally refer to Biden as President-elect or to rebuke Trump for his undemocratic conduct are only further undermining the next administration.Two weeks after the election, it remains surreal and extraordinary that the President is refusing to accept Biden's victory, which matched the 306 Electoral College votes that he himself stacked up in 2016. That he would act in such a way in the middle of a grave national crisis, with 246,000 Americans already dead from Covid-19 and millions out of work, is an even more revealing glimpse into the mind of a President who has consistently prioritized his own goals and gratification over a traditional view of the national interest.Transition tension is a change from recent yearsIt is not unusual for there to be animosity between outgoing and incoming administrations, especially when a president has been ejected from office. The transition from President Herbert Hoover to President-elect Franklin Roosevelt in 1932-33 -- in the middle of another crisis, the Great Depression -- was notoriously prickly.Many White House teams have used their rule-making power to frustrate the policy-making goals of administrations of the opposite party. Trump is already taking things a step further. Military commanders expect orders in the coming days from the commander in chief to begin significant drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan to be completed by January 15, CNN's Barbara Starr reported on Monday. If there are consequences from such a move -- like a collapse of the Afghan government under a Taliban resurgence -- it will be up to Biden to deal with the fallout. There are also expectations that the President will take steps in foreign policy, including stiffened tariffs on China or strengthened sanctions on Iran, that will further trim the next White House's negotiating room.The New York Times reported Monday that the President sought options to strike Iran after his ""maximum pressure"" policy failed to rein in its nuclear program. Such action would make it almost impossible for Biden to revive the Obama administration's agreement with Tehran and international powers. But the report said advisers had dissuaded Trump from triggering attacks that could spark a wider conflict and undercut one of his proudest legacy achievements: avoiding new Middle East wars.And in another apparent attempt to complicate the next administration's quest to lessen America's dependence on fossil fuels, the White House on Monday solicited tenders for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Another departure from normsIn recent years, presidents of both parties have prioritized a peaceful and effective transfer of power over personal political pique, recognizing their duty to secure the health, security and welfare of the American people.Warm letters of welcome left in the Oval Office desk -- for instance, from President George H.W. Bush to Bill Clinton -- have become the norm. George W. Bush's team showed deference to incoming President Barack Obama during the 2008 financial crisis. The 44th President then ordered his team to make life as easy as possible for Trump's incoming White House -- a fact Michelle Obama recalled in a tartly worded Instagram post Monday: ""I was hurt and disappointed -- but the votes had been counted and Donald Trump had won. ... My husband and I instructed our staffs to do what George and Laura Bush had done for us: run a respectful, seamless transition of power -- one of the hallmarks of American democracy.""So the current President's behavior, apparently motivated by fury over his defeat and a conspiratorial belief that the probe into his team's suspicious and multiple links to Russians was part of a plot to render his presidency illegitimate, is a stark departure from recent norms.Trump wants credit for the vaccineIronically, Trump's mood, characterized by wild tweets divorced from any factual anchor, is detracting from his administration's own undeniable achievement in shepherding the swift development of vaccines. Early data released Monday found that the Moderna vaccine currently in trials is 94.5% effective against the coronavirus. This followed news that Pfizer's vaccine was more than 90% effective. The news brought the prospect of a return to normal life and economic activity in 2021. One of Trump's few recent references to the worsening pandemic was a tweet on Monday in which he demanded that historians recognize his role in the vaccine breakthroughs.The President has ordered government agencies not to offer the traditional cooperation with the incoming administration or to allow the release of millions of dollars in funding, office space in agencies and briefings from government officials.Biden initially reacted with circumspection to the move, apparently eager not to further antagonize Trump as the President comes to terms with his dashed hopes of winning a second term. But increasingly, the President-elect is warning of the damage caused by the impasse and is highlighting the vaccine in particular.""The sooner we have access to the administration's distribution plan, the sooner this transition would be smoothly moved forward,"" Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday.While the nation's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has said the vaccine could begin to be administered to high-priority patients like health care workers and the elderly in December, it will likely be at least April until it is available to most Americans. Fauci compared this task to passing a baton in a relay race on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, and said it would be helpful if the transition could begin right away.Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden's Covid-19 advisory board, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday night that obstruction from the administration on the vaccine could have a serious impact on its eventual distribution.""It's very important to know what are the timelines for manufacturing the vaccines,"" Borio said. ""This is not going to be easy; this is a complex task.""But Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown told CNN's Jake Tapper that during a call between state leaders and the White House coronavirus task force on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence made no mention of transferring responsibility for vaccine distribution. ""The Vice President clearly articulated a strategy for distributing the vaccines across the country,""  Brown said. ""But the conversation was extremely disingenuous when we have a new administration coming in in a matter of weeks. There was no conversation about what the hand-off was going to be and how they were going to ensure that the Biden-Harris administration would be fully prepared and ready to accept the baton.""",2020-11-17T05:05:28Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/election-2020-transition-coronavirus-donald-trump-joe-biden/index.html,2020-11-17 10:35:44.866816,CNN,politics,0
Francisco Sagasti: Peru's Congress appoints new leader amid political crisis,"Peruvian lawmaker Francisco Sagasti is set to become the country's next interim president as violence, protest and political crisis grip the South American nation.

Just 26 legislators voted against him.The 76-year-old engineer, academic and former World Bank official is now expected to become Peru's fourth president in less than five years -- and the second one in less than a week.Sagasti's appointment comes as Peruvian authorities struggle to cope with days of violent protests.

Honda unveils its new Civic on Twitch to attract younger buyers,"Honda revealed a new version of its popular Civic compact car Tuesday night. Even as automakers, including Honda, unveil more crossover SUVs and some even drop sedan models altogether, the Civic remains crucial to Honda's success.The Civic, with its affordable price tag, good fuel economy and excellent safety ratings, has been the best-selling passenger car in America for the past four years, excluding corporate fleet sales, and it's on track to be the best seller again this year, according to Kelley Blue Book. The Civic is sold in more than 170 countries but the US, alone, accounts for nearly half of its sales, said Gary Robinson, assistant vice president for product planning at American Honda Motor Company, the Japanese automaker's US arm.The Honda Civic has a longer hood than the current model.""It's been one of the best-selling cars in America the entire time it's been out,"" he said.The Civic was first sold in the US in 1973, shortly after the model was introduced in Japan. It met with immediate success thanks, in part, to an OPEC oil embargo that caused gasoline prices to surge, spurring demand for fuel-efficient cars.Read MoreThe term ""best-selling car,"" of course, does not include crossover SUVs, which sell in even higher numbers these days. That's why Honda's best-selling model overall in the US is the compact sport utility vehicle, the CR-V, not the Civic. Honda wants you to know it can make badass trucks and SUVs, tooBut the Civic is important for Honda because it attracts young, value-focused buyers (prices for the current Civic start at just over $20,000.) Those Civic buyers, as they get older and their incomes increase, often become loyal Honda customers, Robinson said.That's why Honda revealed the new Civic on Twitch, a streaming and social media platform for video game players, Tuesday evening. Two-thirds of Twitch users are under the age of 35, according to Honda. Honda claims to be the only automaker with a dedicated gaming channel on the network.The design of the Civic looks more restrained and upscale than the current model. It's intended to make the car appear larger than it is. New taillights, with a strong horizontal line, add an impression of width.Changes were also made to improve visibility for the driver. The windshield, and the entire passenger cabin, have been moved further back to give the car a longer hood while moving the windshield closer to the driver for better visibility to the sides.The new Honda Civic's taillights are designed to give an impression of more width. Inside, the new Civic will have its first fully-digital gauge cluster as standard equipment. A honeycomb mesh accent along the dashboard hides air vents to give the interior a simpler appearance.Honda didn't provide any details about the car's engine or transmission except that, executives said, manual transmissions will be available in all versions, at least as an option. Executives also said the new Civic will be more powerful and more fuel-efficient than the current model. The company has offered hybrid versions in years past as well, though for the previous generation Honda moved the hybrid model that used the basic Civic design to its own nameplate, Insight.The new Civic will go on sale in the late spring starting with the sedan version. Later, the hatchback and the performance-oriented Civic Si and Civic Type R models will go on sale.

Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon to get a top White House job,"Jen O'Malley Dillon will join President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration as a deputy chief of staff, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.The expected move, first reported by NBC News, is the latest in a long line of expected senior White House hires as Biden moves to fill out his administration.  O'Malley Dillon was Biden's campaign manager, joining his team in March after he consolidated support among most of his primary rivals. She helped transform a shoestring primary organization, which struggled to raise money, into a general election juggernaut that ultimately made Donald Trump a one-term president. She was the first woman to lead a winning Democratic presidential race.O'Malley Dillon will be joining Ron Klain, who was announced as Biden's incoming chief of staff last week, and Rep. Cedric Richmond, who sources tell CNN is expected to leave Congress and join the Biden White House in a senior role.O'Malley Dillon has long told friends that she had no interest in working in the West Wing after the campaign, but after working in top jobs on numerous political campaigns -- including former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's failed 2020 primary campaign and both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns -- the Democratic operative has never served in the White House.Read MoreThat historical pull, said a person familiar with her decision, proved too much to turn down.

""I think as a golfer, we're so ingrained to trying to hit the ball where you're looking, and I think that's one of the great things that Bryson's done.""Bryson, when he speed trains, he just hits the ball into a net, so he doesn't really know where it's going,"" added McIlroy.""He's just trying to move as fast as he can ... and sort of making the target irrelevant for the time being and then you can sort of try to bring it in from there.""From what I've done and what I've been trying -- you know, sort of experimenting with the last couple weeks -- it's the fastest I've ever moved the club, the fastest my body has ever moved.""DeChambeau plays his shot from the ninth tee during the final round of the 120th US Open on September 20, 2020.READ: Masters miracle: Written off as 'gone, done,' the 'Golden Bear' had other ideasIn a league of his ownIt's not as if McIlroy is struggling for driving distance. In the early stages of the 2021 PGA Tour season, he had the third highest average of 333.4 yards. He's now in fifth on 325.3, but in 2017 and 2018, McIlroy led the tour in average driving distance.But DeChambeau is still streaks ahead of the Northern Irishman in terms of average driving distance, averaging 344.4 yards this season.During the American's explosive six-shot victory at Winged Foot Golf Course at US Open, McIlroy was tied for eighth spot, a whopping 10 shots behind DeChambeau.And the 31-year-old found it ""hard to really wrap"" his head around what DeChambeau was doing.""He's worked his ass off to do that and it's paying off hugely,"" McIlroy said.McIlroy plays a shot from the second tee during the third round of The CJ Cup. ""I think it's the way the game's going. I got sent a really good article last weekend, it was in the Wall Street Journal, just about every single sport becoming faster, longer, stronger, and I don't think golf's any different. I'm just trying to keep up with the way it's going.""As players fine tune their preparations for the Masters, which starts on Thursday, November 12, by playing in other events, DeChambeau has adopted a different approach, according to golf.com.There were four PGA Tour events between the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in October and The Masters. DeChambeau chose to not to take part in any of those events.After competing at the TPC Summerlin tournament, DeChambeau says he was planning to work ""out like crazy"" in attempt to add even more muscle, before focusing on his driving.""I don't know how many drivers I'll hit, but I'll hit as many as I need to,"" DeChambeau said. ""And from a speed-training perspective, I could probably go upwards of over 1,000 to probably 2,000, around 2,000 drives the next four weeks trying to get my speed up.""And according to Justin Rose, there's a ""trickle down effect"" inspired by DeChambeau.""I'm hearing kind of rumors out on the range, everyone's trying to crank it up a little bit, get a few more miles an hour,"" Rose told reporters.Even 2017 PGA Championship winner Thomas, who admits he thought DeChambeau's attempts to overhaul his game weren't ""going to work that well,"" is now full of praise for the 27-year-old.READ: US golfer Kirk Triplett explains why the Black Lives Matter movement is so important to himThomas looks on over the 18th green during the final round of The CJ Cup. ""He just won a major at one of the hardest golf courses in the world. And at the end of the day, as far as he hits it, as strong as he's gotten, as much weight as he's put on, he putts the crap out of it to be perfectly honest. I mean, he putts it really well and that's why he won that US Open.""It's not because he can hit it 360 yards. It's because he putts it really well and he's a complete golfer. And I think that's starting to show. But it's definitely an advantage how far he hits it. And it's pretty cool.""He's getting some of us out here to try to find that extra gear. But at the end the day, he's going to continue to work hard and try to get stronger. ""And you just hope that he doesn't hurt himself like a lot of, I guess, other people have trying to get stronger and get fit. But I know that's what I'm doing. I'm trying to get stronger. But most importantly, I'm trying to continue to play injury free.""",2020-11-07T08:32:17Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/07/golf/golfers-changing-bryson-dechambeau-rory-mcilroy-justin-thomas-justin-rose-spc-spt-intl/index.html,2020-11-16 11:26:08.845151,CNN,sports,0
'Ammonite' review: Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan star in a period love story,"""Ammonite"" joins a long list of forbidden love stories, yielding a movie presented in washed-out tones, which shines principally thanks to Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan. The result is a slow-moving, somewhat predictable but finally effective period romance that primarily serves as an old-fashioned testament to star power.Set in the 1840s, the film features Winslet as Mary Anning, an accomplished fossil hunter who plies her trade along the English coastline, selling her discoveries to tourists. Living with her mother (Gemma Jones), she's basically sleepwalking through her hardscrabble existence, other than her work, when she meets Ronan's Charlotte, a wealthy woman afflicted by what her husband unhelpfully describes as ""mild melancholia.""Said husband (James McArdle) has developed an interest in fossils himself, and after seeking her advice, asks Mary to essentially babysit his bride while he goes off to explore. Resistant at first, Mary -- who harbors her own painful past -- is increasingly drawn to her charge, as the two awaken the spark in each other.Written and directed by Francis Lee (""God's Own Country""), it's frankly hard to describe ""Ammonite"" (a reference to the extinct, shelled creatures found embedded in the rocks) without making the movie sound as derivative as it is. The performances, however, elevate the material, as Winslet and Ronan each convey grappling with different kinds of trauma without speaking about what ails them.When they finally do connect -- after what feels like a too-long buildup -- those scenes are raw and passionate. Inevitably, they're also tinged with sadness, given that Charlotte has a home to which she seemingly must return, offering little chance of enduring happiness. Last year's ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (set about 70 years earlier) and the HBO series ""Gentleman Jack"" come to mind as recent examples that similarly filter the LGBTQ experience through the intolerance of the era.Read MoreWinslet and Ronan are no strangers to period fare, including Ronan's star turn in last year's ""Little Women."" Yet the quiet desperation of the former's character perhaps most closely resembles her role in ""Little Children,"" another story in which a seemingly hopeless affair carried a fleeting sense of elation.Pivoting to the hunt for more pragmatic treasures, it's worth noting that Winslet has already collected seven Oscar nominations. Despite being a small-boned movie, in this very strange year it wouldn't be a surprise if ""Ammonite"" lets her unearth another.""Ammonite"" premieres in select theaters on Nov. 13 and premium on demand on Dec. 4. It's rated R.",2020-11-12T14:54:59Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/entertainment/ammonite-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:13:01.678283,CNN,entertainment,0
Tesla set to join the S&P 500 Index in December,"Tesla will join the S&P 500 Index, effective December 21, according to a Monday announcement from S&P Global. Tesla (TSLA), which is now valued at more than Toyota (TM), Disney (DIS) and Coca-Cola (KO), has a market cap of nearly $387 billion. To be eligible to join the S&P 500, a company must be based in the United States, have a market capitalization of at least $8.2 billion, be highly liquid, and have at least 50% of its shares available to the public. Its most recent quarter's earnings and the sum of its trailing four consecutive quarters' earnings must be positive, as well.In October, Tesla reported its largest quarterly profit to date in October, earning $874 million in the third quarter, excluding special items, pushing its income up 156% from a year ago quarter marked the company's fifth consecutive quarter of growth.Tesla will replace an S&P 500 company, information about which company S&P Global says will be released at a later date. The index  committee says it's also considering whether Tesla should be added all at once or in two separate tranches. Read MoreThere are over $11.2 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500, according to S&P Global, including $4.6 trillion of the total in indexed funds.""Clearly this is a key positive for shares and indexing purposes and ultimately removes another question mark around the Tesla story going forward,"" Wedbush analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe wrote in a note to clients. Tesla shares were up more than 10% upon the news, according to Refinitiv. In September, the S&P 500 stopped short of adding Tesla to its index of companies, instead adding Etsy (ETSY), Teradyne (TER) and Catelent. The three companies replaced H&R Block (HRB), Coty (COTY) and Kohl's (KSS).  Bullish investors were surprised by the news and held hopes the automaker would be added, after shares have surged more than 400% this year. -- CNN's Annalyn Kurtz and Clare Duffy contributed to this report.

Opinion: Trump's Pentagon takedown makes the US vulnerable during the transition ,"While much of the world has been preoccupied with the President's refusal to acknowledge his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, Donald Trump has been moving building blocks in a way that, if successful, could have a significant impact on America's security abroad and safety at home.David A. AndelmanOn Monday, the Pentagon issued a ""warning notice"" to theater commanders to begin a further, substantial drawdown of US forces from both Afghanistan and Iraq by January 15, five days before Trump will leave office.This follows Trump's preparatory move, a takedown of the upper reaches of the Pentagon at a critical and most sensitive moment in national security -- the interregnum between two administrations. Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper last Monday and named Christopher Miller, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, acting secretary in his place.Miller's new chief of staff will be Kash Patel, who tried to discredit investigations into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia while he was an aide to former House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes. Retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor, who has made racist and xenophobic comments and called for the use of deadly force at the US-Mexico border, will serve as Miller's senior adviser. The shake-up also involved replacing James Anderson, who resigned from the Pentagon's top policy role on Tuesday, with retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who, according to CNN's KFile, has made a number of Islamophobic tweets, some of which he later deleted, and who once labeled President Obama a ""terrorist leader.""What do these new appointees all have in common? Each of them is likely willing and prepared to implement Trump's military goal of withdrawing US troops around the world. While Trump, who spent years slamming US involvement in ""endless wars,"" has announced drawdowns in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, thousands of US troops are still deployed in the region.Read MoreTrump wanted all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of the year, and sources told CNN's Jake Tapper that the White House may have directed the Defense Department purge because Esper and his team were pushing back on a premature withdrawal there.What the vaccine won't cureStill, if the warning notices are carried through, some 2,500 troops would still be left in each theater -- though Trump's goal had been zero troops by the time he left office. It was unclear whether leaving such a small number of American troops in bitterly contested areas could endanger the safety of those still deployed.Miller issued a memo to the Defense Department just after midnight Saturday that read, ""Ending wars requires compromise and partnership. We met the challenge; we gave it our all. Now, it's time to come home."" Macgregor, on the other hand, made his views apparent when he told Tucker Carlson in 2019 that the US should withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Syria immediately.Even before the latest Pentagon reshuffle, the US timeline to withdraw troops from Afghanistan was wildly inconsistent.US military leaders have stressed that a withdrawal there would be contingent on certain conditions, including the Taliban breaking ties with al Qaeda and making progress in peace talks with the Afghan government. Both of these conditions have not yet been met, and prematurely withdrawing US troops would not only destroy the credibility of our country, but also remove any incentive to achieve these goals.The situation in Afghanistan is fraught. In a quarterly report to Congress on October 30, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reported that the ""average daily enemy-initiated attacks in Afghanistan were 50% higher this quarter (July-September) than last quarter"" and ""above seasonal norms."" The Department of Defense believes the Taliban ""is calibrating its use of violence to harass and undermine"" the Afghan government while keeping these attacks ""at a level it perceives is within the bounds of the [US -- Taliban] agreement, probably to encourage a US troop withdrawal and set favorable conditions for a post-withdrawal Afghanistan.""  A US troop withdrawal could pave the way for the Taliban to return promptly to power.This would only create a bigger headache for the Biden administration. The last time the United States ousted the Taliban from power, after they had been found to be harboring al Qaeda leaders as they were planning the 9/11 terrorist attacks, it took an invasion force of about 2,500. But over time, that force peaked at 100,000 US troops in 2011.Trump team needs to accept reality so transition can workTrump has also expressed a desire to move American forces out of Syria and Iraq, although concrete plans have often conflicted with the President's own messaging. After Trump announced the US would withdraw from Syria in October 2019, a new wave of troops poured in, leaving the total number in Syria largely unchanged. In August, Trump announced all US troops would leave Iraq ""shortly,"" and about three weeks later, a top military commander said the US would be cutting the number of troops there in half, to about 3,000. Now, with the new brass in charge at the Pentagon, Trump could have a clearer path to achieving his goals.In Iraq and Syria, ""an abrupt US pullout removes one of the more major forms of direct and indirect pressure on the countless militia groups controlled by Iran,"" Phillip Smyth, a Soref Fellow at The Washington Institute, and one of America's leading experts on Mideast militias, told me in an e-mail exchange. ""Ideologically and in terms of long-term goals, Tehran wants US forces out, and they want to use any pullout as an example of the US as a paper tiger."" An American withdrawal, Smyth points out, ""would enable Iran to use its militias to fill the vacuum left by departing U.S. forces. Smyth has tracked the emergence of around 20 new front groups, and all have demanded US pullout of Iraq.   History shows us that transitions in US governments can be a vulnerable time.The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, took place on December 21, 1988, as George H. W. Bush was preparing to take over from President Ronald Reagan. And in his final weeks in office in December 1992, Bush, preparing to turn over the presidency to Bill Clinton, ordered 25,000 American troops into Somalia -- which led less than a year later to the deaths of 18 American soldiers in the Black Hawk Down incident.Now, the US focus on Trump's refusal to concede the election and Biden being sidelined from national security briefings could encourage anti-US forces inclined to profit from any perception of American weakness or hesitation.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookThe costs of pulling US troops out of volatile regions prematurely could drag the US back into war all over again. This would be a horrific burden on the Biden administration, especially given the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout.This is not the time for the US to let its guard down and abandon conflicts that will only pose a new threat to our national security -- even if it is being done largely to fulfill Trump's campaign promises rather than because he wants to leave his successor with a toxic legacy to clean up.",2020-11-17T01:44:46Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/opinions/trump-pentagon-afghanistan-us-vulnerable-andelman/index.html,2020-11-17 10:42:21.499987,CNN,politics,0
Donald Trump's failure to work with Joe Biden is becoming more urgent as Covid spreads,"President Donald Trump is facing a barrage of calls to permit potentially life-saving transition talks between his health officials and incoming President-elect Joe Biden's aides on a fast-worsening pandemic he is continuing to ignore in his obsessive effort to discredit an election that he clearly lost.The increasingly urgent pleas are coming from inside his administration, the President-elect's team and independent public health experts as Covid-19 cases rage out of control countrywide, claiming more than 1,000 US lives a day. More than 246,000 Americans have now died from the disease.But instead of listening or mobilizing to tackle what some medical experts warn is becoming a ""humanitarian"" crisis, Trump spent the weekend during which the US passed 11 million infections amplifying lies and misinformation about his election loss. At one point, he appeared to acknowledge Sunday in a tweet that Biden won, before backtracking with a stream of defiance on Twitter.This came as the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that ""of course it would be better if we could start working with"" the Biden team that will take office on January 20.As Trump ignores deepening coronavirus crisis, Biden calls for urgent response""It's almost like passing a baton in a race -- you don't want to stop and then give it to somebody,"" Fauci, who has been marginalized by the outgoing President, told Jake Tapper. ""You want to just essentially keep going. And that is what transition is.""Read MoreBiden's incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Sunday that the President-elect's team had been unable to talk to current top health officials like Fauci about the pandemic owing to Trump's refusal to trigger ascertainment — the formal process of opening a transition to a new administration.""Joe Biden's going to become president of the United States in the midst of an ongoing crisis. That has to be a seamless transition,"" Klain said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" adding that while the new administration planned to contact top pharmaceutical firms making the vaccine like Pfizer, it was particularly key to get in touch with Department of Health and Human Services officials responsible for rolling it out in the coming months.""Our experts need to talk to those people as soon as possible so nothing drops in this change of power we're going to have on January 20th,"" Klain said.But the official who is currently most influential with the President, Dr. Scott Atlas, who critics say favors a herd immunity approach that could lead to thousands of deaths, wrote an inflammatory tweet on Sunday that exemplified the White House's contempt for unifying leadership during the pandemic. Atlas called on the people of Michigan to ""rise up"" against new Covid-19 restrictions introduced in schools, theaters and restaurants by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer -- who was recently the target of an alleged domestic terrorism kidnapping plot. Whitmer said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Sunday evening that she would not be ""bullied into not following reputable scientists and medical professionals.""'We need to be prepared'Fauci is not the only senior US official calling for transition talks to open. Moncef Slaoui, the official in charge of Trump's vaccine effort, told the Financial Times in an interview that he wanted to reach out to Biden's team, but added that he couldn't do so without White House permission.As the Biden team increases the pressure for the launch of a proper transition -- which includes office space, meetings in government agencies and millions of dollars in government funding -- members of Biden's Covid-19 advisory board spoke in increasingly alarmed terms about the effect of a continued stalemate.Board member Dr. Celine Gounder told CNN on Saturday that the situation was like a terrorist attack or war and there needed to be a smooth handoff. ""We need to be prepared, and in the absence of that critical data, there may be blind spots we're not able to anticipate and that leaves us quite vulnerable.""Biden TransitionBiden's toughest foreign policy challenge may be regaining allies' trustAs Trump refuses to concede, his agencies awkwardly prepare what they can for a Biden transitionAnalysis: Biden has a better shot at riding the economy up now than Obama didMAP: Full election resultsAnother board member, infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm, bemoaned Trump's abdication of the crisis and said leadership would only arrive in January, as he pushed for the immediate opening of contacts between the transition and the White House.""It's our hope that in the very near future, we can start to collaborate with them,"" he said, warning on CNN on Saturday of a rapid rise in cases over the next month.An independent expert, Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine, cited research saying that 2,500 Americans could die from Covid-19 every day by January and described the situation as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" that Trump was making worse.""I can't think of a more important time in modern American history,"" Hotez told CNN's Ana Cabrera. ""We need a smooth transition. The fact that, this is the time it won't occur, will only mean greater loss of life, so this is incredibly heartbreaking,"" he said. Biden to deliver economic message As Biden prepares for power despite the obstruction of the President, he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will speak about the economy in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. The President-elect has repeatedly stressed that there will be no long-term rescue for the economy without bringing the virus under control, and he has used his public appearances since the election to plead with Americans to adopt measures like mask wearing that can save lives until Covid-19 vaccines become widely available next year.The pandemic is not the only area where Biden is being deprived of transition privileges usually offered to a President-elect within hours of victory. He still has not been read into America's most closely held secrets in intelligence briefings, for instance. Transition teams are supposed to be able to enter government departments to provide for a trouble-free handover of power at noon on January 20.While much of the rest of the world has moved on and accepted Biden's triumph, and even some Republican senators say that Biden should get intelligence briefings at a minimum, Trump is still fixated on the election.People of color make up nearly half of Biden transition teamFor the first time Sunday, he appeared in a tweet to at least acknowledge that Biden won, blaming his loss on a string of conspiracy theories. He followed up with another tweet refusing to concede and ignoring his failing legal challenges and the reality of Biden's win with several states to spare.Trump played golf twice over the weekend and on Saturday drove past a crowd of supporters protesting the election results in Washington, DC, in between his Twitter rampages. In an interview with CBS ""60 Minutes"" coinciding with the release of his memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" former President Barack Obama compared the behavior of the President to that of a child.""If my daughters -- in any kind of competition -- pouted and then accused the other side of cheating when they lost, when there was no evidence of it, we'd scold them. I think that there has been this sense over the last several years that literally anything goes and is justified in order to get power."" Biden is trying to get the man he defeated to take action now to try to mitigate the desperate situation he is likely to inherit in January. In a statement on Friday, he called on Trump to concentrate on the emergency at hand and to take urgent action.""This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response, which has been woefully lacking. I am the president-elect, but I will not be president until next year,"" Biden said, underscoring the limitations of his position. ""The crisis does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now.""But Trump, who held a press conference on Friday claiming credit for vaccine developments while ignoring the lightning spread of Covid on his watch, appears only to have an interest in one thing: his own diminishing political prospects.",2020-11-16T05:00:13Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/politics/election-2020-donald-trump-joe-biden-transition-coronavirus/index.html,2020-11-16 11:27:38.715856,CNN,politics,0
Rising seas are turning Miami's high ground into hot property ,"In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location."" In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable. READ: Millions of US homes at risk of chronic flooding this century, study saysRead MoreEven now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed. ""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are. Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president. Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach. They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere. ""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.  After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation. A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy. ""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them."" He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead, where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind. Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.

'Sarah Cooper: Everything's Fine' review: Netflix gives the Trump satirist a bigger stage,"Sarah Cooper's spot-on parodies of President Trump turned her into a social-media sensation, a promotional opportunity that didn't present an obvious way to translate that into a more expansive version. Happily, her guest-star-studded Netflix variety special incorporates her most famous shtick -- satirically lip-synching Trump speeches and interviews -- while adding a few extremely clever sketches and, perhaps inevitably, a couple clunkier bits akin to the last 15 minutes of ""Saturday Night Live.""The central concept of ""Sarah Cooper: Everything's Fine"" casts the comic and writer as the host of a happy-talk morning show by the same title, slowly losing her mind (understandably) as she tries to maintain a perpetual faux smile while a pandemic-plagued world crumbles around her.That provides the excuse for a mix of news segments (including a Trump call-in, with Cooper portraying him on the golf course), commercial spoofs and bizarre flights of fancy, punctuated by a parade of big-name guests (the best by far being an interlude with Helen Mirren) indicative of how many admirers Cooper has amassed.Directed by Natasha Lyonne, this exercise in what might be called ""SC-TV"" provides a nifty showcase for Cooper's talents. That said, the hour (OK, 49 minutes) frankly might have been stronger by skipping the detours and adhering more tightly to the news-satire conceit, such as when Cooper discusses the problems faced by zoos before cheerfully adding, ""We'll sugarcoat what happens to all the animals.""The long list of cameos includes Maya Rudolph (who's also among the producers), Jon Hamm, Ben Stiller, Jane Lynch, Megan Thee Stallion, Marisa Tomei and Winona Ryder, putting its star in very good company. Still, this is clearly Cooper's showcase, with a throwback feel to those old variety shows built around comedic standouts like Richard Pryor, albeit with a bit more thematic adhesive and a more consistently pointed political edge.Read MoreTelevision has a spotty track record in seeking to capitalize on performers that have achieved prominence via newer platforms, which tend to innovate out of necessity. By that measure Cooper's Netflix debut is on balance impressive, especially factoring in the logistical challenges of turning it around during a pandemic. (One gag involves the producer of the fictional show, played by Fred Armisen, wearing a series of increasingly elaborate get-ups to protect himself.)At its best, ""Everything's Fine"" is a reminder that everything is most certainly not fine, conjuring laughter by capturing the sheer absurdity of it all, much like Cooper's Trump-channeling videos. That's the gift, in essence, that Cooper has doled out in 60-second bites to those slowly losing their minds, and if nothing else, the special feels like well-deserved recognition for services rendered.""Sarah Cooper: Everything's Fine"" premieres Oct. 27 on Netflix.",2020-10-27T14:13:07Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/27/entertainment/sarah-cooper-everythings-fine-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:20:17.983251,CNN,entertainment,0

'Mank' review: Gary Oldman stars as the troubled writer of 'Citizen Kane',"""Mank"" has the makings of an Oscar contender, and not just because of Hollywood's traditional love for movies about itself. With Gary Oldman as the alcoholic, self-destructive writer of ""Citizen Kane,"" director David Fincher has made a near-great movie about what's in the argument as the greatest of all time.Shot in black and white to breathtakingly evoke the 1930s, the film cleverly adopts a time-hopping format intended to approximate the structure of the movie at its core. In the eye of the storm sits Oldman's Herman J. Mankiewicz, a gifted writer and one-time unofficial court jester at the California castle constructed by media titan William Randolph Hearst (""Game of Thrones'"" Charles Dance) to entertain his guests.The movie finds a recuperating Mankiewicz hidden away in the middle of nowhere, on a tight deadline to finish the ""Kane"" script for 20-something auteur Orson Welles (Tom Burke, simply uncanny in capturing his voice and manner). He dictates the script, working with a secretary (Lily Collins) and live-in nurse (Monika Gossman) while fighting an ongoing battle with booze.While that's happening, the movie (from a decades-old script by Fincher's father, Jack, who died in 2003) hopscotches back and forth in time, revealing Mankiewicz's first-hand knowledge of Hearst and close relationship with his mistress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried), which makes the scribe's insistence that the character in ""Citizen Kane"" isn't really her far less convincing.Only a few years removed from his Academy Award for ""Darkest Hour,"" Oldman inhabits another larger-than-life (if not quite Churchillian) figure as the guy who insists on being called ""Mank,"" painting a masterpiece that, at just 43, he seems to intuitively understand might be his first and last.Read MoreUsing typed-out script notes to set up scenes, the flashbacks are awash in Hollywood lore, from studio mogul Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard) functioning as Hearst's toady while raging at others to figures like executive Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley) and producer David O. Selznick (Toby Leonard Moore), back when guys like Mankiewicz were seen as replaceable chumps -- ""just a writer,"" as he's dismissively told.Even his studio-exec brother, Joe (Tom Pelphrey), can't be counted upon to protect his interests, warning Herman that in taking on Hearst, ""you're hunting dangerous game.""Granted, it's difficult for any trip back through the bad old days of the studio system not to feel a trifle cliched, but ""Mank"" effortlessly conveys all that showbiz history in a breezily entertaining package. As difficult as it is to portray the creative process on screen -- man agonizes in front of typewriter -- Fincher's approach does so better than most.""You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours,"" Mankiewicz muses out loud, a meta commentary if there ever was one, coming in this movie biography about Welles' legendary roman a clef that seeks to do just that.""Mank"" arrives at an intriguing time, as Netflix's slow but steady campaign to scale the heights of Oscar glory seems poised to pay off, thanks in part to a pandemic that has leveled the distribution playing field.If cracking that code has at times seemed as elusive as finding a certain sled, with ""Mank,"" the streamer might have a movie that it can ride all the way to the top.""Mank"" premieres Nov. 13 in select theaters and Dec. 4 on Netflix.",2020-11-13T15:26:33Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/entertainment/mank-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:18:51.914456,CNN,entertainment,0
SpaceX-NASA mission: Four astronauts arrive at International Space Station,"The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft that launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center with four astronauts on board Sunday night safely docked with the International Space Station around 11 p.m. ET Monday. The spacecraft glided toward the station, closing the gap before latching onto a port on the ISS's center module. The event appeared to be a slow burn to those watching NASA's livestream, but that's because the spacecraft and the ISS were traveling at roughly the same speed — more than 17,000 miles per hour, the speed necessary to keep objects orbiting the Earth.  The astronauts —  Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker with NASA,  and Soichi Noguchi, an astronaut with Japan's space agency — emerged beaming from the capsule about two hours later after a series of checks were performed to ensure that the spacecraft and the ISS had an air-tight seal. They had been on the capsule for roughly more than 30 hours. The newly arrived astronauts shared hugs and greeting with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Russia's Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who are already onboard the ISS. They arrived last month on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.Kathy Lueders, NASA's head of human spaceflight, radioed in to speak to the crew shortly after arrival.Read MoreThe safe docking marks the end of the first leg of a landmark mission for NASA and SpaceX, which have been working together for a decade to return human spaceflight capabilities to the United States and ensure the multibillion-dollar ISS stays fully staffed.As many as 13 astronauts were on board at one time in 2009. But that number has occasionally dropped to as low as three, which leaves fewer people to help run experiments and help keep the space station well maintained, according to NASA.This also marks the first fully operational crewed mission for SpaceX, following up a test mission in May that carried NASA astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken, both test pilots, to the space station for a brief stay.SpaceX launch: Four astronauts take off aboard Crew Dragon bound for ISSGlover's inclusion in this mission, called Crew-1, has its own historic significance. Though more than a dozen Black Americans have traveled to space since Guion Bluford became the first to do so in 1983, Glover will be the first to become a full-time crew member on the ISS. This also marks Glover's first-ever trip to space.During a brief dispatch between mission control and the astronauts Monday afternoon, mission commander Hopkins asked ground control operators if they could see Glover smiling ""because it hasn't stopped since we've been up here.""Earlier on Monday, Hopkins also gave Glover his diamond-studded, golden astronaut pin, which is awarded to all NASA astronauts who have traveled to space. Glover shared fist bumps with his crew mates and showed off the golden emblem, a star with three contrails surrounded by a halo, to viewers on NASA's livestream.The Crew-1 astronauts are expected to spend about six months on board the ISS, where they'll work on a variety of science experiments and conduct space walks to continue updates and repairs on the space station's exterior.Before returning home, they'll be joined by yet another group of astronauts on a mission dubbed Crew-2 that's due to launch in the spring.

Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints. The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change.Read: While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by itRead MoreBut some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference. Spend wiselyThe buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.    ""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.German architects  Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.Read: Climate change: Do you know the basics?Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes. ""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities. ""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods. DivestmentAs well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in. Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany. But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment. Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest. Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies. Watch: Why climate change worries the world's largest companies""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto. And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""  Wealth means power Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers. There is more CO2 in the atmosphere today than any point since the evolution of humansOtto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.  ""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.Fund climate researchThe wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy. Can coral farms save our reefs?In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues. ""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years. Role models The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions. ""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters. Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

House GOP modifies their dinner for freshman members after Democrats altered theirs amid coronavirus concerns ,"House Republicans turned their dinner for freshman members scheduled for Sunday night in the Capitol into a carry out meal, a person in the room told CNN, following the path of House Democrats, who last week modified plans for their own indoor dinner after facing criticism for planning such a gathering amid surging coronavirus cases. Earlier Sunday, Republicans were moving ahead with the dinner following Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying Saturday morning his team would discuss their plans for the dinner after Hill Democrats changed their own plans. But less than an hour after the Republican dinner was set to begin Sunday evening, 45 tables were set for two in an empty Statuary Hall. CNN has reached out to McCarthy's office.McCarthy had defended the dinner Saturday, echoing comments by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday when initially defending her caucus' dinner. ""But what we did beforehand, we had the medical doctor come in, we put a new vent system in there,"" the California Republican told Fox News on Saturday. ""It's a one-time dinner at the Statuary Hall, and we've taken all of the precautions, following the CDC and others of what you can and how you can meet together, and that's what we're trying to do, is to secure the safety of every individual.""Read MoreHouse Democrats' dinner was modified after backlash on social media that showed Statuary Hall filled with tables with hardly any social distancing.""Members-elect are now picking up their boxed meals and departing the Capitol. There is no group dinner,"" Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, tweeted Friday evening. Pelosi had told reporters earlier on Friday that the venue was ""very spaced"" and that there were safety protocols in place. ""It's very spaced, we have all the permission and the ventilation from the doctor,"" she said.A senior Democratic aide had told CNN there was enhanced ventilation in the room, that only four members would be at each table, and that the event was happening under the direction of the Office of the Attending Physician.In an earlier Friday evening tweet, Hammill had also defended the indoor dinner, saying: ""Our office strictly follows the guidance of the Office of Attending Physician, including for this dinner. To be a further model for the nation, this event has been modified to allow Members-elect to pick up their meals to go in a socially-distanced manner.""The coronavirus pandemic has continued to worsen and the United States hit a new daily record for new cases on Friday, with more than 184,000 new cases reported, according to Johns Hopkins University data.A group of incoming House Republican freshmen visited the White House Friday night, according to multiple postings CNN has spotted on social media. Among the members-elect were QAnon-promoter Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, who won the former seat of White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.The members-elect, who were not wearing masks in most of the photos, got a tour of the White House but did not meet with President Donald Trump, according to an administration official with knowledge of the President's schedule.Politico first reported the visit, and said it was spearheaded by McCarthy. His office declined to give a comment to CNN about the visit. Pelosi has frequently criticized Trump for the White House's handling of the pandemic.Earlier Friday during her weekly news conference, the California Democrat admonished Republicans to ""listen to science on the way to the vaccine"" and highlighted the need for isolation and separation.""Testing, tracing, treatment, mask-wearing, isolation, separation, sanitation all of those things because the sooner we do that and the sooner we have a vaccine, the sooner we crush the virus,"" she said. ""I hope it would be an incentive for people to follow science.""At a separate news conference on Thursday, Pelosi said of the pandemic and the devastation it has caused, ""This is a red alert and all hands on deck, but it should have been a long time ago. The President and the Republicans in Congress have ignored by delay, distortion, denial.""She went on to say, ""Deaths have been caused. And what are they doing now? Continuing to ignore, in spite of these numbers that should be so compelling, that are an imperative for us to act upon this. Every kind of avoidance of taking responsibility has been witnessed. Every chance that we had for testing, tracing, treatment, mask wearing, separation, sanitation, that science tells us to do, they have ignored.""This story has been updated Sunday with additional reporting.

"Antibiotic use in babies linked to allergies, asthma and other conditions, study finds","Children younger than two who are given antibiotics are more likely to have a number of ongoing illnesses or conditions later in life, a new study finds. Multiple doses of antibiotics were associated with a variety of illnesses in later childhood. Babies and toddlers who received one dose of antibiotics were more likely to have asthma, eczema, hay fever, food allergies, celiac disease, problems with weight and obesity and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder later in childhood, according to the study published Monday in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.Multiple antibiotic treatments below the age of two was associated with a child having multiple conditions, the study found, with the illnesses differing due to the child's gender, age, type of medication, dose and number of doses.""We want to emphasize that this study shows association, not causation, of these conditions,"" said senior study author Nathan LeBrasseur, a researcher at Mayo Clinic's Center on Aging.

A microbiome connection?Why would antibiotics have such an impact -- if indeed future studies repeat the connection?It's possibly due to the disruption of the bacteria in a baby's gut, which is needed for the proper development of the immune system, neural development, body composition and metabolism, LeBrasseur and his team said.Antibiotics do not discriminate between ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the digestive tract, killing all of them and leaving the gut without the appropriate microbiome distribution. We need certain bacteria to absorb nutrients, break down foods in intestines and protect the entire digestive system from pathogens.An explosion of research about our microbiome has found it can play a role in everything from how we respond to chemotherapy to our brain chemistry and immune response.""When antibiotics were first developed and deployed, the overwhelming consideration was control of pathogens.

Global economic bailout is running at $19.5 trillion. It will go higher,"Governments and central banks have promised to shell out $19.5 trillion since the coronavirus erupted to ""put a floor under the world economy,"" according to the International Monetary Fund. Some countries need even more help to recover from the crisis, but they might not get it.Governments have announced nearly $12 trillion in stimulus measures as of September and central banks have chipped in at least $7.5 trillion to soften the impact of the pandemic on their economies, the IMF said in its annual report on Monday.Yet despite the unprecedented scale and speed of the rescue, which cut taxes, paid wages, granted loans to small businesses and took interest rates to record lows, the global economy is suffering the worst recession since the Great Depression. Economic activity and employment in large parts of the world, including in the United States and Europe, remain well below levels seen before the pandemic hit. The economy as we knew it might be over, Fed Chairman saysWhile coronavirus vaccine candidates point to improved prospects for the global economy next year, they won't help countries much in the immediate future. And roadblocks to securing additional financial support could damage the already fragile recovery.""Countries now face a long ascent that will be difficult, uneven, uncertain and prone to setbacks,"" said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.Read MoreIn the United States, where the number of virus cases is exploding, President Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election to Joe Biden could hold up efforts to agree another major stimulus package. The country is still down some 10 million jobs since before the pandemic began and several states are now imposing fresh restrictions to curb the rise in cases, which will further weigh on the recovery.The European Union, meanwhile, is facing an internal revolt that could delay the final approval of its €800 billion ($950 billion) coronavirus recovery fund, which took months to negotiate and is due to kick in on January 1.Asia's economies are bouncing back. The West is headed in the other directionOn Monday, Hungary and Poland moved to block the package over attempts to link its distribution to respect for the rule of law, casting doubt on whether much needed funds will get to the hardest hit EU economies, including Italy, Spain and Greece. EU leaders are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting on Thursday.Economists say that dialing back government support too soon will undermine the strength of the recovery from the pandemic. While central banks are expected to unleash even more stimulus to try and juice their economies, they lack an established channel to send money directly to households. Withdrawing fiscal support prematurely is ""the biggest risk"" facing economies in the short term, according to Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.""This would be a self-defeating mistake,"" he said in a research note on Tuesday.That's because an extended period of weak demand, which large scale fiscal stimulus has mitigated, poses the greatest threat to economic growth, he added.— James Frater contributed reporting.",2020-11-17T15:47:11Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/economy/global-economy-coronavirus-bailout-imf-annual-report/index.html,2020-11-18 08:46:08.313242,CNN,world,0

(Think colds, flu and Covid-19.)""What we eat is very important in terms of how our immune system responds to pathogens and how well it can defend itself against a pathogen,"" said Dr. Simin Meydani, senior scientist and leader of the nutritional immunology team at Tufts University's Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging.Micronutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B complex, zinc and selenium help ""pump up"" two basic parts of the body's defenses. The innate immune system springs into action as the first line of defense, followed by the adaptive immune system, which sends killer T cells, antibodies and other soldiers into combat.Just how much you can jump-start immunity with nutrients depends on your age, overall health and stress levels, experts say. Mediterranean diet slows cognitive impairment, studies sayBut if you are overweight, smoke, drink, have a chronic disease, are overly stressed or sleeping poorly -- and who isn't these days? -- focusing on the food you eat may pay immunity dividends this winter.Read MoreTip: It's also important to stay at a healthy weight, reduce your stress, get quality sleep and regular exercise to keep those natural defenses in fighting shape. Without that healthy baseline, your body will have to work harder to knock out invaders -- and may even lose the match.Immune-boosting dietIs there an immune-boosting diet? The answer is yes -- but there is no need to download or print a list of specific superfoods for your next shopping trip.""You're not going to see the benefit that you want to see by eating a large amount of one single nutrient or food component,"" Meydani explained.That's because the body's cellular immune response relies on harmonious interactions between different micronutrients found in a huge variety of whole foods.Therefore, the best route to a healthy immune system is to eat a large variety of fresh and colorful red, yellow, orange, blue and green fruits and vegetables each day, along with some high-quality whole grains, a bit of lean protein and a splash of healthy oils. Does that recommendation seem familiar? Yes, that's the healthy eating plate you've seen so many times. Fill your plate with a majority of fruits and vegetables -- the more the better, research says.A wide variety of colorful foods is also the basis of the top-rated Mediterranean diet and DASH diet, which stands for ""dietary approaches to stop hypertension,"" or high blood pressure. Both the Mediterranean and DASH diets avoid processed foods and focus on fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds.Numerous studies found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. Meals from the sunny Mediterranean region have also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life. Oh, and weight loss, too. Pump up the volumeIf you want to maximize the impact of food on your immune system, you'll need to  dramatically increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day, Meydani says.Mediterranean diet: How to start (and stay on) one of the world's healthiest dietsHer team investigated immune responses in animals fed two to three servings of fruits and veggies a day, and compared them to those who ate five to six servings a day or eight to nine servings a day.""The eight to nine servings a day was where we were seeing the best effect,"" Meydani said. ""So it's not just increasing the intake by a little bit, you've got to increase it substantially. People need to work at it in order to reach that level.""Finding ways to insert fruits and veggies into every meal and snack during the day may do more than pump up your immunity. A 2017 study found a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer and early death by eating 10 portions of fruit and vegetables each day.Current dietary guidelines in the United States only recommend up to two cups of fruit and two to three servings of vegetables a day. Yet nearly 90% of Americans eat fewer than three servings of vegetables, while more than 70% didn't meet the daily recommendations for fruit consumption, according to government estimates of US eating patterns.How to eat less meat and more plantsIt's not just Americans. A 2017 study found one in five deaths globally -- that's about 11 million people --occurred because of too much sodium and a lack of whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds. Is supplemental needed?Just like any mammal, the human body is built to absorb nutrients from whole fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains and proteins more efficiently than processed foods or supplements. But people with limited access to healthy food choices or who have certain medical conditions or anyone over the age of 65 may need to focus on adding specific micronutritents to their diet. ""I'm not talking about the frail elderly that are homebound,"" Meydani said. ""I'm talking about older people who are healthy, active, but above the age of 65. For them, I think certain nutrient supplementation might be very helpful.""Zinc: Most people in the United States get enough zinc from the foods they eat. But a study by Meydani's team found 20% of older, independent living people had low levels of zinc in their blood, while 30% of older people living in nursing homes had no suitable levels of zinc. How to stop throwing away your veggies and fruitThe study of 500 older adults found those with low serum zinc levels had twice as much pneumonia and a longer duration of pneumonia and antibiotic use than people with adequate levels.""Zinc has some very strong evidence behind it,"" said Megan Meyer, director of science communications for the International Food Information Council, a nonprofit dedicated to science-based information about health, nutrition and food safety.""There are a variety of ways zinc acts on the immune system,"" she said, including being able to ""bind to influenza virus and inactivate it.""Other groups that might benefit from zinc supplements include alcoholics, vegetarians and people with digestive disorders such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, according to the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements.Using zinc lozenges in the early stages of cold or flu, such as in the first 24 hours, may give the immune system a boost in fighting the pathogen, Meyer said. The daily recommended dose is 8 milligrams for women and 11 milligrams for men for no longer than five days.Don't take zinc in high doses or long term -- that's been linked to copper deficiencies -- and avoid taking it nasally or ""you might lose your sense of smell,"" Meyer said. Tip: Zinc can also interfere with the effectiveness of antibiotics or negatively interact with some blood pressure and rheumatoid arthritis medications, so check with your doctor before adding it to your diet.Stress eating lately? The 'hunger meter' can helpSelenium: Selenium plays an important role in inflammation and immunity. We need the mineral, found in soil and absorbed by plants, to activate immune cells. It also appears to be able to reduce inflammatory response. Most Americans get plenty of selenium from their diet -- it can be found in seafood, meat, poultry, eggs, dairy products, breads, cereals, and nuts, especially Brazil nuts, which can contain up to 91 micrograms.It would only take five Brazil nuts to reach the daily upper limit of selenium for adults -- 400 micrograms a day. Taking too much can cause nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, loss of hair or nails, discolored teeth, irritability and nervous system problems, according to the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements.Vitamin C: Hundreds of studies over the years have looked at the benefits of vitamin C for the immune system -- and clinical trials are currently underway investigating the impact of vitamin C transfusions on the severity of Covid-19. Most people believe that vitamin C boosts the immune system and protects against colds. However, reviews of studies to date find only a mild beneficial effect compared to a placebo, leaving many experts loathe to sing its praises.Should you take a dietary supplement to prevent disease?  ""I really struggle to see the direct benefit of vitamin C supplementation,"" Meyer said. ""It doesn't prevent colds. It might reduce the length and severity, but you can add an asterisk to that too.""Vitamin E: This vitamin can play a dual role in boosting the body's immune response. It acts as an antioxidant in the body, helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals.""Vitamin E can have an anti-inflammatory effect, but it can also boost your cell-mediated immunity in certain populations,"" Meydani said. A study by Meydani and her team of vitamin E supplementation in the elderly found that people who took supplements had ""significantly lower incidence of upper respiratory infections,"" she said. Some of the best sources for vitamin E are vegetable oils like sunflower and safflower; peanuts, hazelnuts and almonds; seeds; and wheat germ. Many people turn to supplements to boost their intake -- but be careful, high doses of vitamin E might increase the risk of bleeding.""The optimal level from our studies was 200 international units per day,"" Meydani said. ""This is very important, because people think that if something is good for your immune system, then the higher you go, the better it will be. And that's not the case."" Stress eating these days? Here's some helpVitamin D: It's early days, but scientists are studying the connection between vitamin D and Covid-19. Most promising is the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D -- the hope is that supplementation will tamp down any hyperactive immune response to the virus. ""Cytokine storms,"" where the immune system goes haywire and overwhelms the body, are one of the leading causes of death from Covid-19. Just like vitamin C, evidence on D's immune-boosting properties is mixed, Meydani said.""We can't say that giving higher levels of vitamin D is going to improve your immune response and fight respiratory infections,"" she said. ""Some studies have shown some benefit, but others have not confirmed them.""Your body makes vitamin D from the sun, so people with darker skin or who live in areas with little sunshine might be deficient, as are the elderly and exclusively breastfed babies, who require a daily supplement. Many foods in the Western diet are supplemented with vitamin D, and taking too much can be toxic.  ""Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements,"" according to the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements. ""Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness and weight loss.""Anti-inflammatory foodsMediterranean diet named the best for 2019There's another reason to pack your plate with a variety of fruits and veggies -- the need to control your body's inflammatory response to bacteria and viruses.  ""A certain amount of inflammatory response is needed to get rid of the pathogens and to help the the body's immune system perform its function,"" Meydani said. ""But if you produce too many inflammatory components, it can be damaging to surrounding  tissues. It can cause autoimmune diseases. It can cause chronic diseases.""Chronic inflammation has been linked in studies to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, Alzheimer's and many other diseases.Unfortunately, today's Western diet is full of overly processed, fat-laden foods, sugary drinks and red and processed meats that can cause persistently high levels inflammation in the body. Eating a lot of unhealthy, ""ultraprocessed"" foods may shorten your life -- just a 10% increase in such foods was significantly associated with a 14% higher risk of death from all causes, studies have shown.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Fight back by limiting inflammatory foods such as ice cream, cookies, pastries, cereal bars and cakes, premade pies, pasta and pizza dishes, poultry and fish nuggets and sticks, cocoa and fruit-flavored drinks, ""health"" and ""slimming"" products such as powdered or ""fortified"" meal and dish substitutes, powdered and packaged instant soups, noodles and desserts, sausages and hot dogs.Instead, choose leafy greens, tomatoes, fruits, nuts, fatty fish and olive oil -- foods that can support a healthy inflammatory response without sending it into overdrive.",2020-11-16T10:07:28Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/health/immune-boosting-foods-wellness/index.html,2020-11-16 11:35:55.718982,CNN,world,0

World's only known white giraffe gets fitted with a tracking device,"The only known white giraffe in the world has been fitted with a GPS tracking device in an effort to protect him from poachers in Kenya. The unique male giraffe now stands alone after a female and her calf were killed by poachers in March.The GPS tracking device, secured to one of the animal's horns, will give hourly updates of his location, said the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy in a press release on Tuesday. Rangers will be able to monitor the giraffe's movements in the conservancy located in Garissa County, eastern Kenya.The world's only known white giraffe lives in the Ishaqbini Community Conservancy, Garissa County.""The giraffe's grazing range has been blessed with good rains in the recent past and the abundant vegetation bodes well for the future of the white male,"" said Ahmed Noor, manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy.Read MoreNoor thanked the Kenya Wildlife Service, Save Giraffes Now and the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) for their help in safeguarding wildlife species.Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary ""Our mission is to work with communities, enable them [to] be resilient, secure their livelihoods as well as protect the unique wildlife like the only known white giraffe,"" said  Antony Wandera, senior wildlife monitoring officer at the NRT.The male giraffe has a rare genetic trait called leucism, which results in the partial loss of pigmentation in an animal and makes it easy to spot for poachers on the arid savannah. Unlike albinism, animals with leucism continue to produce a dark pigment in their soft tissue, meaning the giraffe's eyes are dark.In March, the remains of two of the stunning white giraffes that lived at the Kenyan wildlife sanctuary were found in a skeletal state, killed by poachers.A Global Positioning Satellite unit was placed on one ossicone (horn) of the giraffe to aid effective monitoring.The female white giraffe first made headlines when she was discovered, alongside her calf, in 2017. A second calf followed, and the family of three lived a free-ranging life within the confines of the sanctuary, where they generated a lot of interest from tourists around the world.Visitors flocked to see the family of three, stretching for glimpses from behind the trees.

NFL: Chicago Bears quarterback Nick Foles carted off field with injury,"Chicago Bears quarterback Nick Foles had to be carted off the field on Monday in the dying seconds of a 19-13 loss to division rivals the Minnesota Vikings.Trailing by six points with 40 seconds left on the clock, Foles was searching for a pass to win his side the game. The quarterback was pinballed around as the pocket collapsed, before defensive end Ifeadi Odenigbo eventually made it past the offensive line and slammed Foles to the ground.The tackle didn't look particularly dangerous compared with the numerous hits made during every NFL game, but Foles remained on the floor, clearly in a lot of pain.Replays showed the Super Bowl LII MVP took the full force of the landing on his right side.Foles lay on the field for over a minute and, after Bears medical staff saw to him on the field, Foles was carted off to the locker room.Nick Foles lay on the field for over a minute before it was deemed safe to move him and cart him off the field.Read MoreAfter the game, Bears head coach Matt Nagy said that his quarterback's right hip and leg were still being evaluated.""When I got out there right away, I wasn't sure what it was,"" said Nagy.

Opinion: China's new wildlife law doesn't go far enough to stop another pandemic,"The biodiversity crisis -- the rapid and escalating disintegration of the living systems upon which we all depend -- has in many ways been overshadowed in 2020. This was supposed to be a ""super year"" for biodiversity, marking the confluence of several major intergovernmental meetings where big commitments were to be made. Most of these did not happen, mainly due to the disruption caused by the pandemic.The emergence of Covid-19, which has infected more than 54 million people worldwide, was initially linked to a market in Wuhan, China where wild animals were sold.High-level discussion of the potential role that the wildlife trade played in triggering the pandemic meant that, for a brief period at least, political and public attention honed in on the commercial exploitation of wild animals. Destruction of natural habitats, climate change, industrial livestock farming and exploitation of wildlife are all key drivers of both the biodiversity crisis and increased risk of pandemics. While we don't know exactly how Covid-19 -- which possibly originated in bats -- first came to infect humans, broader scrutiny of the wildlife trade was long overdue.Read MoreChina's wet markets are not what some people think they areHopes that this newfound attention might convince key governments to adopt a more cautious approach were bolstered in February, when China announced a ban on the trade and consumption of all wild animals as food. Around the same time, the Chinese government announced that the country's Wildlife Protection Law would be revised. The legislation has long been controversial; despite its stated intention to protect wild animals, its language often permits commercial trade in wildlife -- even endangered species.Following the announcement, Chinese NGOs, academics, medical experts and lawmakers publicly called for bans to be extended to include the use of wild animals in China's traditional medicine industry.Now, almost a year later, with much political attention having seemingly moved on, a new draft of China's wildlife law has been published, but the result is a puzzling and frustrating document. Security guards stand in front of the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province, on January 11.On one hand, it consolidates what remains one of the most ambitious policy changes adopted by any government in response to Covid-triggered concerns over wildlife trade -- a near comprehensive ban on breeding, selling and consuming terrestrial wild animals as food. If implemented effectively and ethically, including proper provision of compensation for farmers, this could be good news for many species. Yet these prohibitions sit alongside language that allows commercial use of wild animals for non-food purposes, such as ""exhibition"" or traditional medicine. Moreover, the species that can still be bought and sold include some of the world's most endangered wild animals, which are being driven to the brink of extinction by demand for their body parts.The scales of an estimated 745,000 pangolins being traded illegally have been seized in the past decade, with the majority of seizures destined for China, where they are in demand for use in traditional medicine. Customs officers look at seized endangered pangolin scales displayed during a press conference at the Kwai Chung Customhouse Cargo Examination Compound in Hong Kong on February 1, 2019.Despite a 2016 ban on international commercial trade, Chinese authorities maintain a domestic market in pangolin scales through dubiously managed mechanisms that are replete with opportunities to launder smuggled stock. Leopards, Asia's most heavily trafficked big cat, face a similar problem. The international trade has been banned since 1975 and only a few hundred remain in the wild in China, yet authorities continue to permit production and sale of tonic wines and pills claiming to contain leopard bone. Other products made from endangered animals that can still be legally traded in China include saiga antelope horn, the bile of farmed bears and the skins of captive-bred tigers. Even where products in legal trade are derived from captive populations, there are serious concerns that this serves to stimulate demand for the product sourced from the wild, not to mention often horrific animal welfare implications.Chinese government reveals draft list of animals which can be farmed for meatThe new draft law doesn't just pose risks to biodiversity by legitimizing the consumption of threatened species in some cases, such as traditional medicine, but its inconsistent approach to disease risk could also undermine the law's ability to prevent further outbreaks of diseases such as Covid-19.Specific risks may vary, but if lawmakers believe the threat from breeding and processing wild animals for food is so high that it must be comprehensively stopped, why allow the same activities in the name of different types of consumption?Most traditional Chinese medicine does not use the body parts of threatened wild animals. Many practitioners and academics would like to see them replaced, and indeed recognize the image problem posed to the whole industry by the actions of a minority. Yet the incongruity of approach in China's draft wildlife law suggests a lobby representing the interests of that minority still holds significant sway within Beijing's opaque decision-making structures.Frustratingly, this is despite genuine progress in environmental policies elsewhere, such as Xi Jinping's recent pledge for carbon neutrality by 2060.Members of staff of the Wuhan Hygiene Emergency Response Team conduct searches on the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province, on January 11, where the Wuhan health commission said at the time that the man who died from a respiratory illness had purchased goods.In May 2021, China is due to host a major environmental summit for the first time -- the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The world's wildlife cannot afford for this to be another failed attempt at multilateral action. While all governments urgently need to get their own house in order, the role of the host in setting an example of meaningful policy change can be crucial. Yet as it stands, China's wildlife legislation is still acting in direct opposition to the need to end exploitation of threatened wildlife.",2020-11-18T01:46:22Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/opinions/china-wildlife-law-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-18 08:57:22.021626,CNN,world,0
How bad is Russia's Covid crisis? Packed morgues and excess deaths tell a darker story than official numbers suggest,"The limbs of a lifeless body hang off a stretcher in a hospital ward as coronavirus patients battle for their lives just a few feet away. An elderly woman gasps for breath, her desperate panting a grim soundtrack to one of many disturbing cell-phone videos emerging from hospitals across Russia.""This is how our nights look: horrifying,"" says a male voice narrating the footage, given to CNN by a prominent opposition-linked Russian doctors' union, ""Doctors' Alliance,"" which says it was recorded in mid-October by a hospital staff member in Ulyanovsk, a city around 500 miles east of Moscow.""Two more down in our ward,"" he says, while filming a corpse. ""This is how Covid-19 is killing everybody.""   Scientists cautious as Russia says early data shows Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is 92% effective This grisly video is just one of several obtained by CNN that reveal appalling conditions inside overcrowded facilities. Some footage shows morgues with bodies, stripped naked, piled on top of each other on grimy floors, in scenes that look like war zones more than hospitals. As Russia struggles to get the pandemic under control, the videos are one of several signs pointing to an actual death toll far higher than official figures suggest.     Read MoreRussia says as of November 16 more than 33,000 people have died of Covid-19. But that number is disputed by critics who say the Kremlin is underreporting the numbers.""I think the real figure is [around] 130,000 people,"" said Alexey Raksha, a former government statistician who has made his estimates based on official data on excess deaths -- the number of fatalities above what would normally be expected -- to assess the toll of the pandemic.      Workers wear protective equipment in Novoye Kolpinskoye Cemetery, Saint Petersburg, during a funeral in May.Using data from local registries, Raksha estimates that Russia reached around 160,000-170,000 excess deaths from April to November. He attributes around 80% of these fatalities to Covid-19 -- an average number aggregated from similar statistics published by Western countries.     Between April and September 2020, Russia's official excess mortality figure was roughly 117,000 more deaths, compared to last year, according to Rosstat, the Russian statistics agency. The official Covid-19 death toll for that period is roughly 21,000 people.There is no Rosstat data available yet for October and November, but judging by official tallies released by the country's coronavirus response center, the spread of the pandemic has accelerated rapidly.  Raksha says he quit Rosstat in July after being publicly vocal about the way the agency counts coronavirus-related deaths. He says that the discrepancy between the official figures and his calculations is due to the way that Russia classifies its Covid casualties.   Reality bites for Putin's much-hyped Covid-19 vaccine, as concerns over efficacy and safety linger  Rosstat uses a four-tier classification system, he explains. According to the agency's website, they are: 1. the patient testing positive for Covid-19 before death; 2.when Covid-19 is presumed to be main cause of death but would need to be confirmed by autopsy or further research; 3. when the virus contributed to death in those with underlying conditions; 4. when Covid-19 is confirmed but not deemed a major factor in the death.""Only the first tier of victim, when the patient has tested positive for coronavirus before dying, is recorded as a Covid-19 death,"" Raksha told CNN. According to Raksha, deaths in all three other tiers are left out of the official figures.  Neither the Russian health ministry, the public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, nor Rosstat have responded to CNN's requests for comment.   A scene from a video given to CNN showing an overcrowded morgue in Russia's Ulyanovsk region in October.This counting method differs from World Health Organization guidelines, which states that all deaths related to Covid-19 should be counted unless there is ""a clear alternative cause that cannot be related"" to the disease.As it battles the pandemic, however, Russia still knows how to put on a good show. In August, amid much fanfare, it became the first country to register a coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, even before crucial Phase 3 trials had started. That vaccine, which was met with skepticism by outside scientists, has not yet been widely administered.  CNN was also granted rare access to a 1,300-bed state-of-the-art temporary coronavirus hospital in Moscow, set up in what was a world championship ice-skating stadium, called the ""Ice Palace.""The Krylatskoye Ice Palace, which has been converted into a coronavirus field hospital in Moscow.""The crisis is complicated but manageable,"" the chief doctor, Andrey Shkoda, told CNN as he gave us a tour. ""We have all the necessary diagnostic equipment here, ultrasound, anesthesia and ventilators.""Looming above, a gigantic screen that usually broadcasts skating or ice-hockey scores to the crowd is now used to show movies to patients as they undergo treatment. The chief doctor said the hospital is fully digital; every patient is assigned a bracelet with a QR code which links to all their healthcare records.""This is standard care,"" he told CNN, across Moscow and beyond.Yet this rosy picture of a country in full control of the pandemic, with a network of spacious medical facilities, seems increasingly at odds with the graphic footage emerging from hospitals, a deeper examination of the official statistics and the testimony of some medical workers.Last month, the Russian government admitted a growing strain on its medical facilities, with Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova saying hospital beds in five of the worst affected regions were already at more than 95% capacity.Staff with the body of a deceased patient at the Novomoskovsky medical center in Kommunarka, outside Moscow, in April.One ambulance driver in the Saratov region of southwest Russia -- who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions at work -- said the situation in his hospital is ""a mess.""

"Greenland's glaciers could lose more ice than previously thought, raising concerns for sea level rise","Greenland's largest glaciers could lose even more ice than previously predicted -- a development that could have huge consequences for the rate of global sea level rise, according to a new study published Tuesday.Greenland's ice sheet is already melting rapidly, and that ice loss is one of the main contributors to rising sea levels. Planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are accelerating this melt. But what experts have less information on is how these vital glaciers have changed in the past, particularly in the centuries before satellite records existed. Understanding how glaciers have responded to past changes in climate can impact projections scientists make about how they may respond to future warming. The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, has filled in some of those gaps. The researchers found that Greenland's glaciers are very sensitive to climate conditions, and have lost ice in the late-19th and early-20th century at rates that rival or surpass those seen today. With the planet -- and the Arctic in particular -- expected to warm much more this century, the scientists warn their findings show that ice loss on Greenland could exceed even the worst-case projections.Read MoreDavid Holland, a professor of mathematics and environmental science at New York University and a co-author of the study, said the team's findings show that the Arctic ""is undergoing a one-two punch with respect to the loss of its land and sea ice covers in a warming world.""Using historical photographs of the Jakobshavn, Helheim and Kangerlussuaq glaciers, the team calculated ice loss from 1880 to 2012. They estimated that the amount of ice lost from these three glaciers alone resulted in a sea level rise of 8.1 millimeters. Holland said that while the three glaciers are important in their own right, they also serve as proxies for the majority of the other outlet glaciers in Greenland, giving scientists a glimpse at how the entire ice sheet behaves. Greenland's ice sheet is melting as fast as at any time in the last 12,000 years, study showsGreenland's ice sheet is a dynamic place that is constantly shifting and moving. If we think of the interior of the ice sheet as a mountain lake, Moon says, these outlet glaciers are the streams fanning out from the lake, carrying ice away from it and in many cases, into the ocean. When ice breaks off from the glacier and lands in the ocean, it raises sea levels.""These three glaciers are among the fastest moving in Greenland. When we think about these glaciers all around the edge of Greenland acting like conveyor belts (moving ice towards the ocean), these are some of the fastest, largest conveyor belts on the ice sheet,"" said Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, who wasn't involved in the study.The glaciers also hold enough ice to raise global sea levels by roughly 1.3 meters.Ice loss over time is driven by natural shifts in winds and ocean currents, and when warm waters get near the glaciers, they melt, Holland says. But human-caused warming has altered the climate and is changing how the winds and ocean interact with the ice sheet, and therefore influencing the amount of ice loss.The team found that rates of ice loss for the Jakobshavn Glacier in the early 1900s were comparable to the huge rates of loss seen today, and for the Kangerlussuaq Glacier, ice loss between 1880 and 1930 was actually larger than present day.That's significant because it shows that the glaciers were losing large amounts of ice at a time when global temperatures were lower than they are now. Under a worst case-scenario in which humans continue to raise concentrations of these heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, the planet could warm by 3.7 degrees Celsius (6.66 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century. If the glaciers have already suffered large ice losses when atmospheric and ocean temperatures were lower -- and the planet is set to warm even more under a high-emissions future -- the scientists say their findings could mean models used to predict future ice loss in Greenland could be underestimating how much will be lost by the end of the century. Let's talk about the climate apocalypse That could also impact current projections of sea level rise.Rising seas are already causing problems in many low-lying coastal areas. And for places like New York and Shanghai, 1 meter or more of sea level rise could spell disaster. Another recent study found that rising seas could cost the global economy $14.2 trillion in lost or damaged assets by the end of the century, and expose as many as 287 million people to episodic flooding, up from 171 million today.""I think when it comes to the pace of change in Greenland and really with ice everywhere in the world, we're already at five-alarm status,"" said Moon. ""And this paper is one more paper in that monstrous pile that says these are really serious changes, they're happening very quickly and we we need to be taking action as soon as possible so that we can try to reduce the rate of change in the future.""In the study, the scientists said that the possible underestimation of ice loss is likely ""not limited to just these three glaciers,"" and that it was important that models capture rapid glacial retreat as a result of human-induced warming of our oceans and atmosphere ""as they are the primary driver of mass loss.""The team hopes their findings on how glaciers are sensitive to changes in the climate will help increase the reliability of future projections of ice loss. ""The Arctic is losing ice, and as you look in greater detail over the last century, you see periods of more loss and less loss, but always loss,"" Holland said. ""With increased warming projected to continue into the future, increased ice loss can be expected with potentially serious negative consequences for coastal cities around the world.""CNN's Ivana Kottasova contributed to this report.",2020-11-17T16:46:25Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/world/greenland-glaciers-melt-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-18 08:59:09.711961,CNN,technology,0
Premarket stocks: Elon Musk is now an A-lister on Wall Street,"Tesla has no shortage of doubters. But on Monday, the company got a stamp of approval from Wall Street that sends a clear message: It's time for the fast-growing electric carmaker to go mainstream.What's happening: After months of speculation, Tesla will join the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Monday. The company became eligible earlier this year after booking four consecutive profitable quarters. It's now been in the black for five consecutive quarters, a first in its 17-year history.Tesla (TSLA) shares are soaring on the news. The company's stock, which has jumped nearly 388% this year, is up another 12.5% in premarket trading.

Tesla's meteoric stock rise has drawn skepticism from some investors, who have worried that its hefty valuation doesn't reflect the huge challenges it still faces. A struggling Toyota still expects to sell 9.4 million vehicles in its current fiscal year, while Tesla is targeting 500,000 deliveries.Wall Street has also at times been reluctant to embrace Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose unfiltered use of Twitter led to a dust-up with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Read MoreBut Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 is a clear marker of just how far the company has come.""Taking a step back, this is a major feather in the cap for the Tesla bull,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.Last quarter, buoyed by strong demand for the more affordable Model 3 and the early success of Tesla's Gigafactory in Shanghai, the company booked record profits and delivered more cars than ever before. Ives said this made it impossible for S&P Dow Jones Indices to keep Tesla out of the benchmark index much longer. What happens next: Shares may be added to the index in two separate tranches in order to minimize disruption, per S&P Dow Jones Indices. The company had a market valuation of nearly $387 billion as of Monday's close.Once it joins the S&P 500, the company will attract large groups of new investors, according to Nick Hyett, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.Previously, Tesla's investor base largely consisted of active fund managers who bought into the company's mission, Hyett told me. Now, passive fund managers in charge of portfolios that mirror the S&P 500 won't have much choice but to get in on the action.""Most passive funds [that track the index] will be essentially compelled to buy the stock,"" Hyett said. Otherwise, they'll have to answer to inquiring clients.Vaccine frenzy sends stocks to record highsExcitement about Covid-19 vaccines that could help facilitate a return to normal life has sent stocks rocketing to all-time highs.The latest: The Dow and S&P 500 closed at records levels on Monday after Moderna said its experimental coronavirus vaccine is highly effective. Pfizer made a similar announcement about its vaccine candidate last week. The Dow is now just 50 points shy of 30,000 points, a psychologically significant level for market bulls.Driving the rally: Moderna's vaccine has a significant advantage over the one from Pfizer when it comes to distribution.Pfizer's vaccine has to be kept at minus 75 degrees Celsius. No other vaccine in the United States needs to stay that cold, and doctors' offices and pharmacies don't have freezers that go that low. But Moderna's vaccine can be kept at just minus 20 degrees Celsius. The company also said it can be kept for 30 days in the refrigerator. Pfizer's vaccine can last only five days in the fridge.""Last week's Pfizer news was great, but today's Moderna vaccine news is even better,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. ""Being able to store the vaccine in a standard fridge for up to a month makes transportation and usability so much easier.""Investor insight: Moderna (MRNA) shares leaped 9.6% on Monday. They're up more than 400% this year.Also bullish: Warren Buffett. His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, bought new shares in pharma companies AbbVie (ABBV), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Merck (MKGAF) and Pfizer (PFE) during the third quarter, the company disclosed Monday.How Airbnb turned a profit last quarterDespite a pandemic that's dealt a big blow to its business, Airbnb managed to make money last quarter.The startup, which unveiled its paperwork to go public on Monday, revealed that it turned a profit of $219 million between July and September as customers used the platform to plan domestic trips, or took advantage of remote work to book longer-term stays in new locations.""Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home,"" the company said in its filing. ""Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb.""The company still had a difficult start to 2020, reporting net losses of $916 million through June 30. The fourth quarter could also be difficult as another wave of infections takes hold in many of its key markets.Despite the tough operating environment, Airbnb's public offering is highly anticipated among investors. The company is one of the most valuable private startups in the world, at one point notching a valuation of $31 billion.Up nextHome Depot (HD), Kohl's (KSS) and Walmart (WMT) report results before US markets open.Also today:US retail sales data for October arrives at 8:30 a.m. ET.

In his 250th F1 race, Hamlton claimed his 84th win of his career, moving him just seven behind Schumacher's all-time record.And having already wrapped up his sixth F1 World Drivers' Championship title at the US Grand Prix, the Briton is just one off the German's record of seven. Read MoreWith the prospect of Hamilton surpassing some of Schumacher's records in 2020, F1 broadcaster and journalist Will Buxton believes the British driver is ""redefining the sport.""""Lewis is the only driver in history to have won a Grand Prix in every season he's ever contested, no matter the machinery at his disposal, no matter the rivalries he's faced on and off track,"" Buxton told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. ""We talk about Michael, we talk about what he achieved. And those are records that were never supposed to be broken. ""And we're now looking at Lewis thinking he's about to match Michael next year, potentially.

""I mean, how disconcerting is that for the rest of the of the grid, but how incredible, how strong does that make a sportsman that they turn up with nothing to lose and they are at the peak of their game. How do you beat that? How do you beat somebody that's just doing it for fun?""Hamilton is often subjected to his fair share of criticism -- from the social media posts and interviews he's given -- which sometimes detract from his abilities on the track.And although his competitors will be relishing the day Hamilton decides to call it quits, they can have nothing but admiration for him. ""He consistently raises his level and they all see that, they all respect that because you don't just turn up and win races,"" Buxton explains. ""You have to work at it and even though we might look at it and say: 'He's just doing it for fun' and I'm sure he is, you can be damn sure he's working as hard, if not harder than anybody else on that grid to maintain that level. ""Because if you're at the top, and if you have that level, consistently hitting that level has to be incredibly hard.""READ: Formula One plans to become carbon neutral by 2030JUST WATCHEDLewis Hamilton 'could go on until he's 40,' says dad AnthonyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLewis Hamilton 'could go on until he's 40,' says dad Anthony 03:13Not in a rushThe iconic black horse on a yellow background and the striking red Ferrari car are powerful F1 symbols.

Michelle Obama reflects on how she put her anger aside for a peaceful transition,"Michelle Obama has weighed in on the refusal of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump to move forward with a transition of power to the incoming administration, reflecting on where she was four years ago and how -- though the process of ceding responsibility to the Trumps was difficult -- she persisted. ""I was hurt and disappointed -- but the votes had been counted and Donald Trump had won,"" the former first lady wrote in a post on her Instagram account.

She confessed in her Monday post: ""None of this was easy for me. Donald Trump had spread racist lies about my husband that put my family in danger. That wasn't something I was ready to forgive.""The presidential transition process has not officially started because Trump has baselessly refused to accept President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The formal transition is likely to remain on hold until the election is certified by a Trump appointee within the General Services Administration in a process known as ascertainment.Obama said in her post that it took ""strength and maturity to put my anger aside.""

'I Am Greta' chronicles the birth of Greta Thunberg's climate crusade,"Greta Thunberg's inspiring children's crusade on the climate-change crisis receives dutiful if somewhat sluggish documentary treatment in ""I Am Greta,"" an intimate portrait of the teenage activist that at its best conveys her courage and spirit, before bogging down in what becomes a somewhat repetitious call for action.For those familiar with the name but perhaps not the details, at 15, Thunberg began a lonely school strike outside the Swedish parliament to awaken people to the dangers of climate change, arguing that kids must take up the cause because adults weren't.""I want you to act as if the house is on fire,"" Thunberg says, chiding government leaders for their inaction, and for mortgaging the future of those generations that will survive them.Directed by Swedish filmmaker Nathan Grossman, ""I Am Greta"" puts the lie to many of the criticisms directed at Thunberg, most from dismissive conservative pundits, whose unbecoming gibes are presented alongside images reminding us that Thunberg is a teenager, despite her extraordinary poise.For starters, Thunberg very clearly chose this fight, not her parents, who have been accused of using her to serve their political goals. They appear, rather, understandably concerned and protective.Read MoreAs for those put off by Thunberg's tendency to lecture adults, the angry tone reflects both a sense of urgency and her frustration over their unwillingness to heed the science.Greta Thunberg in the documentary 'I Am Greta' (Courtesy of Hulu)The documentary captures the remarkable inroads that Thunberg has made -- addressing conferences and parliaments, meeting with world leaders like France's Emmanuel Macron and strategizing with Arnold Schwarzenegger -- as well as the dizzying demands all this has placed upon her time and energy. The film feels too drawn out, however, during what amounts to its extended climactic sequence, in which she is invited to speak at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in 2019.Because she won't fly (Thunberg doesn't just talk the talk but walks the walk, griping about the lack of vegan options at a climate conference), the trip requires a harrowing ocean voyage to New York -- a journey presented in exhaustive and, indeed, exhausting detail.""I Am Greta"" nevertheless stirs admiration for Thunberg's idealism, a passion that has transformed her from a shy kid into the leader of a youth movement. ""Change is coming whether you like it or not,"" Thunberg says in one speech, expressing her attitude that when it comes to this particular fight, those in power must either lead or get out of the way.In the broadest strokes, the film succeeds in its primary objective, which is to draw attention to Thunberg's cause. It's in the execution where ""I Am Greta"" sometimes can't get out of its own way.""I Am Greta"" premieres Nov. 13 on Hulu.",2020-11-12T15:00:16Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/entertainment/i-am-greta-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:18:30.008424,CNN,entertainment,0
National Book Awards: Meet their first undocumented finalist,"Karla Cornejo Villavicencio says she's suffering from survivor's guilt.In 2010, she penned a widely read anonymous essay for The Daily Beast about life as an undocumented student at Harvard.In October, less than a decade later, she became a finalist for a National Book Award.It's the first time an undocumented immigrant has been named a finalist for the prestigious prize, whose winners are slated to be announced Wednesday. ""I felt extremely guilty because my people are dying,"" she says, noting how the coronavirus pandemic continues to take a devastating toll on the undocumented community. ""But I feel very honored, and I hope that I am the first, but not the last.""Read MoreCornejo Villavicencio is no longer undocumented; she recently received her green card and became a legal permanent resident. The stories she tells in ""The Undocumented Americans"" aim to reveal the complex lives of people who are often oversimplified or overlooked -- who, as she puts it in her book's introduction, ""don't inspire hashtags or T-shirts.""""This book is for everybody who wants to step away from the buzzwords in immigration, the talking heads, the kids in graduation caps and gowns, and read about the people underground,"" she writes. ""Not heroes. Randoms. People. Characters.""She says the results of the 2016 election pushed her to tell stories she'd witnessed all her life but had never seen in print.""I had read a lot of books that I felt did not do a good job of representing migrants in an interesting way. It was mostly bad writing. It relied a lot on caricatures and cliches,"" she says. ""And I always thought I could do better, but I just never felt like I had a fire in my belly until the night of the election.""In ""The Undocumented Americans,"" she stands on street corners with day laborers on Staten Island and goes to therapy with workers who were on the front lines cleaning up wreckage after 9/11. She speaks with families in Flint, Michigan, who are still scared to drink the water and meets with women in Miami who turn to herbal remedies when the healthcare system shuts them out.Through it all, she weaves in her own family's story in a work of creative nonfiction that critics have lauded as ""captivating and evocative"" and ""deeply revealing.""Cornejo Villavicencio spoke with CNN recently about the book, her journey, and the stories she feels need to be told. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.""The Undocumented Americans"" is dedicated to Claudia Gomez Gonzalez, who was killed by a Border Patrol agent in 2018. Why did you decide to dedicate it to her? She wanted to come here and study and be a nurse. And I feel that she was killed in cold blood. And yet at the time that I heard about her death, I felt very guilty and I felt personally responsible. She came here because she wanted a better life, which is classically what Americans have been told this country is for, but they no longer accept it. They want people to be fleeing, like, an asteroid. And I felt like I represented, you know, that life, which was education, ability, a different world. And it's hard to explain, but I felt like I had betrayed her in some way because people like me had not been entirely open about the fact that we were being hunted here. You make a point of not sugarcoating things, describing the good things about your characters, but also not shying away from talking about their flaws. Why was it important for you to write the full picture of the people you met? These are people I know and love and these are people that share life experiences with me. I had not gotten the full picture from anybody before, so I had to. Also I'm a good writer, so I couldn't imagine a world in which I would write a two-dimensional character if I tried. ... I would have [had] to do what a lot of people do, which is just believe in the template that Hollywood and publishing give you that is ""what Latino literature is supposed to sound like,"" and write in that template. I'm sure that perfectly nice, smart, intelligent, provocative, good writers do write these dumb books because they're writing for White readers. And I could have written one of those books if I chose to write for a White audience, but I didn't. I chose to write for children of immigrants. I chose to write for immigrants. I chose to write for people of color. And, you know, that's why it's a book that has base notes in it. It's not a simple fragrance. When you were talking about this notion that people practically have to be fleeing an asteroid to be deemed worthy, it made me think of this trope of ""the good immigrant"" -- the idea that only certain kinds of people are deserving of having their stories told or being protected under the law or that kind of thing. Was that something on your mind as you were choosing what stories to tell and how to tell them? I chose to not talk about reasons why people chose to come here, because that enables the readers to judge for themselves whether the reasons are worthy or not. And it's none of their f**king business. If people cross deserts or oceans and risk their lives and then have a hell of a time here, who are you to say that this is a worthy enough decision to come here? We just don't owe that to each other. Politicians and academics and sociologists and activists decided that in order to move the needle towards empathy, we needed to know the reasons [why people immigrate], and what we've seen is that actually hasn't been successful. People see us as animals. And now they see us as scapegoats, and they don't care what the reasons are. That's why in my book, I don't try to change anyone's mind. God bless you to the people who do try, but that's not my job. Karla Cornejo VillavicencioWhat has it been like for you having these stories that you know and reported so intimately out in the world? I hope people love them. I hope immigrants and children of immigrants are inspired by them to create their own art. In your book, you talk about the undocumented victims of 9/11, particularly the so-called ""delivery boys"" who perished, and you make the allusion to the ""disappeared"" in Latin America. It made me think about the stories that we've been hearing about the pandemic and all the people who have been impacted. Do you see any connection there?In the spring in New York, the number of deaths of Latinos -- many of them immigrants who were dying in ways that were completely undignified, like their bodies stuffed into frozen trucks on the street -- and, you know, there were no obituaries, the majority of the country was not caring and choosing to ignore Covid because they knew the people who were dying were Black and brown. I saw the list that The New York Times printed of the people who died. And it reminded me of 9/11 and the incomplete list of the people who died on 9/11. How have the people who you featured in your book been doing in the pandemic?Not well. They are the delivery workers and the janitors and the people who work in restaurants. I saw, like, literally everybody in my community be out of a job and have zero safety net.One of the day laborers in the book, his friend who was pregnant was turned away from the hospital even though her fever was extraordinarily high. And then when she came back to the hospital, she slipped into a coma and they cut the baby out of her and she was still in a coma. And he just told it to me matter-of-factly, because it surprised nobody -- because of language access, because there are documented cases of discrimination against Black people and brown people in the medical field. This is bad, but it's not surprising.When immigrant stories are told in the media, is there anything that gets left out that you feel should be included? Immigrant stories told by immigrants. I think that there is a great crop of writers who understand nuances and we understand complexities and we understand secrets and we have access that other people don't have. You've said you were inspired to write this book after the 2016 election. And as we're talking now, the results of another election are being counted. Is this moment inspiring you to write anything? I want to steer away from writing about immigration for a little bit because it's taken an extreme toll on my mental health. And I think that the book I put out into the world did what I wanted it to do. I've heard from a lot of readers that it has allowed them to articulate things that they didn't think they could articulate to themselves -- a lot of children of immigrants, a lot of immigrants themselves. I feel like I did what I set out to, and I stopped thinking that it's a requirement of good writing to end the day shaken and to be immobilized by trauma the day after. So I'm going to try to step away from writing about immigration for a little while. I have another book coming up, but it's a novel, and that's sort of a different thing. Can you talk a little bit more about why you feel it took a big toll on your mental health to tell these stories? I was unprepared to think about things like intergenerational trauma and about migration itself as this living monster that you can never get away from, even when you become a citizen. That's why on the cover of my book, there are bloody fingerprints alongside the papers. I think that it's like being haunted. I couldn't think about any of those things while I was writing the book in a healing way, because in order to heal, I would have had to distance myself. I needed to write a book that was a snapshot in time, but that was also a fair appraisal of what my life had been like and what it feels like for a child of immigrants. So I couldn't go on my healing journey while I was writing this book. Also, I have borderline personality disorder and I feel things in extreme ways. When I'm discussing some things that are extremely painful, I feel them in bodily ways. I feel chills. I get a low-grade fever, I have stomach aches. I get migraines.You recently got your green card in the mail. What's it like to no longer be undocumented?  I've had a work permit since I was on DACA, so I continue to be able to legally work. And just like when I was fully undocumented or on DACA, I continue to be able to be deported. So it gives me some amount of safety. But like people who understand the system know, it's complicated. And it's not like everything is OK now. My parents, my family, people I love are still undocumented and I could literally be deported for any small thing. I'm happy that I continue to have a work permit and I'm able to continue writing for a living.",2020-11-16T13:43:11Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/us/undocumented-americans-karla-cornejo-villavicencio/index.html,2020-11-17 10:34:38.449619,CNN,politics,0
'537 Votes' review: BIlly Corben's HBO documentary revisits Florida election chaos ,"The timing of ""537 Votes"" isn't subtle, focusing on election chaos and chicanery surrounding the 2000 Florida recount weeks before concerns about a repeat two decades later. The HBO documentary, however, provides a contextual, nuanced view -- rooted in the controversy over Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez -- while painting a colorful portrait of the ensuing battle, when the Democrats brought the equivalent of a strongly worded letter to a knife fight.Director Billy Corben knows Florida well, and he niftily sets up the key players in a drama that even the HBO movie ""Recount"" couldn't entirely do justice. Yet he traces that back to the outrage triggered by the story of Gonzalez, whose mother died bringing him to the US, as her family wrestled with his father over the boy's return to Cuba.Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore split with the Clinton administration over the case, reflecting the importance of Florida in the 2000 race. ""Everyone on both campaigns knew it was coming down to Florida,"" recalls Gore attorney Mitchell Berger.The Republicans, though, not only had that strongly motivated portion of the Cuban-American community on its side, but once the electoral skirmish began, a team of operatives who engaged in bare-knuckled tactics and sound bemused and completely unapologetic reminiscing about them now.Indeed, the end-justifies-the-means attitude is summed up by none other than Trump ally Roger Stone, who tells the filmmakers, ""Politics is about winning."" (In the documentary, Stone is accused by Bush campaign operative Brad Blakeman of inflating his role in what transpired, a contention that Stone shrugs off.)Read MoreWhoever deserves the credit and/or blame, the primary takeaway from ""537 Votes"" -- aside from presenting Miami as a hotbed of craziness -- is that while Gore's representative, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, wanted to send the world a broader message about decorum and democracy, Republican steadfastly focused on victory.Toward that end, their efforts to halt the vote counting -- including the so-called ""Brooks Brothers Riot"" -- were ""run with care and with shrewdness and evil intent, and it worked,"" Miami political reporter Michael Putney says.The Miami--Dade Canvassing Board and attorneys reviewing ballots during the 2000 Florida recount. (Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times via of Getty Images/Courtesy of HBO)Corben cleverly frames the unfolding story with cultural and musical artifacts of the era, weaving in snippets from ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""The Daily Show"" and ""South Park"" to underscore how Florida became a national punchline (in a way that has largely lingered until today), while everyone suddenly became an authority on the subject of ""hanging chads.""Among other things, the election-night section includes clips of then-CBS anchor Dan Rather going hog wild with his famous Dan-isms, saying the heat from Florida -- as the state moved in and out of the Gore, Bush and ""too close to call"" columns -- was ""hot enough to peel housepaint.""Perhaps the most fascinating figure in the documentary is then-Miami-Dade County mayor Alex Penelas, who appeared destined for bigger things (he was dubbed ""The Great Cuban Hope"" as well as People magazine's ""sexiest politician"") before his role in the 2000 campaign.While some of the details might have faded with memory, ""537 Votes"" nicely encapsulates the descent of politics into a blood sport where rivals are viewed as enemies, not opponents. Wherever one falls on the political spectrum, reliving the tumult and mayhem of that campaign it's reasonable to hope the past isn't prologue, and that what happened in Florida two decades ago doesn't serve as the extended trailer for 2020.""537 Votes"" premieres Oct. 21 at 9 p.m. on HBO. Like CNN, HBO is a unit of WarnerMedia.",2020-10-21T13:46:07Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/21/entertainment/537-votes-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:19:56.420535,CNN,entertainment,0
Health care: Here are 7 Trump measures that Biden will likely overturn,"When it comes to health policy, President Donald Trump made it his mission to undo many measures his predecessor put in place.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to do the same.In their four years in office, the Trump administration made sweeping changes that affected the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, abortion and transgender rights, in many cases reversing the efforts of the Obama administration. Most of the measures were done through executive orders and regulation since it was tough to get any bills through Congress, particularly after the Democrats took control of the House after the 2018 midterm elections.How has the Affordable Care Act affected you? Share your story.Biden's health officials will likely be active, as well, but it will take time for all their actions to take effect. ""They don't have a massive eraser pen. They've got to go through the rule-making process,"" said Allison Orris, a former Obama administration official and counsel with Manatt Health, a professional services firm. ""They are going to have to think about what comes first, second and third and be realistic about timing.""Read MorePlus, the Biden administration may opt to keep and continue several Trump administration efforts, including shifting to value-based care, rather than paying doctors for every visit and procedure, and increasing access to telehealth, said Ian Spatz, senior adviser at Manatt. The two administrations also share common views on some measures to lower drug pricing, including basing Medicare payments on the cost of prescription medications in other countries and importing drugs from abroad. But Trump officials have not actually put these proposals in place.However, where the two administrations will differ significantly is messaging, Spatz said. While Trump focused on dismantling the Affordable Care Act, Biden will emphasize expanding the law and access to health coverage.Here are seven Trump health care measures the incoming Biden administration is expected to reverse.Work requirementsThe Trump administration took the historic step in early 2018 of allowing states to require certain Medicaid recipients to work in order to receive benefits. Eight states have received approval, seven have pending requests and four had their waivers set aside in court, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, work requirements are not in effect in any state currently.The Supreme Court will decide on November 20 whether to consider a case challenging work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire.Biden's Health and Human Services secretary would be able to unwind the approvals, but it is a complicated task, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. The secretary would have to determine whether to withdraw permission for the entire waiver or just certain features.Goodbye and good riddance to Medicaid work requirement waivers.— Joan Alker (@JoanAlker1) November 8, 2020 Several of these waivers included other provisions that could make it harder for low-income Americans to retain Medicaid coverage, such as lockouts for non-payment of premiums.And just before Election Day, the Trump administration approved Georgia's waiver that will allow the state to replace the federal Obamacare exchange, healthcare.gov, with a private platform.While secretaries have the power to reverse waiver approvals, it isn't typical. More common is setting new guidelines for when a waiver comes up for renewal and for new applications.Short-term health plansOne executive order Trump repeatedly points to is expanding short-term health plans, which typically have lower premiums, but provide less comprehensive coverage and don't have to adhere to the Affordable Care Act's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The President has touted them as a less expensive alternative to Obamacare.In 2018, the administration allowed Americans to purchase these plans for just under a year, reversing the Obama administration's move that restricted their durations to only three months.""The short-term plans have important symbolic significance because they restrict coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, which was a prominent political issue in the campaign,"" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Affordable Care Act funding cuts In its first year in office, the Trump administration slashed funds to promote Obamacare open enrollment and to assist consumers with selecting plans by 90% and 84%, respectively. Many Affordable Care Act advocates point to a lack of advertising as a reason why sign ups have slipped in recent years. Trump officials also cut the open enrollment period on the federal exchange to six weeks, half of what it was before.And during the pandemic, the President refused to open up a special enrollment period to allow the uninsured to select policies -- despite insurers' and even several Republican governors' requests to do so.The Biden administration is expected to reverse all these measures to curtail Obamacare.Title X abortion referral restrictionBiden has promised to revoke the Trump administration rule barring federally funded health care providers in the Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions.Title X serves about 4 million people a year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. It provides funding for projects offering resources including contraception, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and preventive education and testing for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV -- but not abortions.Last year, HHS moved to bar health care providers participating in the program from discussing abortion with patients or offering abortion referrals, prompting multiple federal court challenges resulting in blocks on the rule. In July 2019, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the court's prior ruling the rule to go into effect despite the ongoing challenge against it. The following month, the court denied Planned Parenthood's request to reverse its order, prompting the organization to withdraw from the program.The impact of the rule going into effect has been stark. About 900 clinics dropped out of the program by the start of 2020, according to a report by reproductive rights group Power to Decide, citing instances of more limited and expensive services. Additionally, after HHS opted to reassign relinquished Title X funds to other remaining participants, a Kaiser Family Foundation report found gaps in the new coverage.The American Medical Association, the main industry group for doctors, asked the Supreme Court last month to block the rule, citing conflicting rulings after the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's block on the rule in September.Mexico City PolicyBiden has vowed to reverse the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, which Trump reinstated and expanded during his tenure. The Trump administration reinstated the measure -- which had previously impacted only family planning assistance -- in 2017 by presidential memorandum and extended it to all applicable US global health funding under the ""Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.""Organizations that continued to promote or perform abortions stood to lose all US health aid under the policy -- affecting more than 1,300 global health projects and an estimated $12 billion in US assistance in 2017-2018, according to the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress.In September, the Trump administration advanced a proposed regulatory rule to further expand the ban, which already encompasses global health grants and cooperative agreements, to apply to contracts. The rule's 60-day comment period ended Friday. Based on data from 2013 through 2015, global health funding provided through contracts could account for almost 40% of all funding affected by the expanded rule, Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at Kaiser, said at the time.Initially put in place by the Reagan administration, the policy has been rescinded by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republican presidents, most recently retracted by the Obama administration in 2009. Even during the Obama years, US law banned direct funding for abortion services. But NGOs that performed the procedure were allowed to receive US funding for other programs, including those related to contraception access and post-abortion care.Planned Parenthood fundingThe Biden administration is also expected to reinstitute a directive that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that separately provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. Medicaid funding does not cover abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is at risk, due to the Hyde Amendment dating back to 1976.In 2018, HHS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors rescinding a 2016 Obama administration directive from April 2016, which warned cuts to family planning providers would break federal law. Trump also signed a bill in 2017 allowing states to withhold federal money from organizations that provide abortion services, including Planned Parenthood.LGBTQ regulationsThe Trump administration has been particularly hostile toward transgender Americans. Among its most criticized moves was an effort earlier this year to rollback an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender. A federal judge blocked the repeal this summer, ruling it violated a recent Supreme Court decision. Biden's website specifically refers to the effort and says he ""will defend the rights of all people -- regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity -- to have access to quality, affordable health care free from discrimination.""  Biden's LGBTQ policy plan also says he will work to expand funding for mental health services for LGBTQ Americans and that his administration plans to automatically enroll low-income LGBTQ people in the public option, once it's created, if they live in rural areas in states that didn't expand Medicaid.",2020-11-15T19:22:38Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/politics/biden-overturn-trump-health-care-policies/index.html,2020-11-16 11:39:36.313445,CNN,politics,0
US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it.  Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014. If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.  Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development. The most effective way to tackle climate change? Plant 1 trillion trees""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said. Read MoreMore than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says. ""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region."" The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation. Why you should be forest bathing (and we don't mean shampoo)The lost value amounted to $96 million a year. Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society: Heat reduction: Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings, parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up."" Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams. Noise reduction:  Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits. Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says. Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property. Improved human health:  Many studies have found connections between exposure to nature and better mental and physical health. Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies. Doctors are even prescribing walks in nature for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with lower death rates. Wildlife habitat:  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life. Planning for treesGardening becomes healing with horticultural therapyNowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways."" Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being."" Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""'America's Amazon' is at risk The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.  ""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""How you can help stop tree loss Protect what you have:  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true."" Prune the dead limbs out of your trees:  If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said. Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice. Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary:  Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow."" Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control. Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

Why football needs a 'global game approach' to tackle the risk of degenerative brain disease,"The 1960s were in full swing. The Beatles and The Stones topped the charts, shoppers flocked to Carnaby Street and the mini skirt and Mini car were in maximum demand. Amid that cultural sea-change, England's football team won the World Cup on July 30, 1966. It's the first and only time that's happened and England defender Nobby Stiles' celebratory dancing jig encapsulated a nation's delight.Fast forward to October 30 and a nation mourned as Stiles died at the age of 78 from prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Stiles is one of a number of ex-footballers diagnosed with dementia and his death has intensified the debate surrounding the sport's worrying relationship with degenerative brain disease. Soon after Stiles' death, it was disclosed that Bobby Charlton, a World Cup winner with England in 1966, has dementia. Jack, his brother and former 1966 teammate, died with dementia earlier this year. Read MoreOf the 11 players that started that 1966 final for England, at least five, including Ray Wilson and Martin Peters, went on to develop some form of dementia or Alzheimer's disease, while former striker Helmut Haller, who scored for West Germany in the final, passed away in 2012 having suffered from Parkinson's disease and dementia in later life.  Tributes are paid to Nobby Stiles outside Old Trafford ahead of his former side Manchester United's game against Arsenal earlier this month. More than 50 years since England's World Cup triumph, football is still coming to terms with the scale of the problem it faces.  ""When you go into football at a young age, and certainly as a young professional, you realize that in the later stages of your life, you're going to have ankle problems and knee problems and back problems, very much like I have,"" Alan Shearer, the English Premier League's record goal scorer who fronted a BBC investigation into the link between football and dementia, told CNN in 2017. ""Never did I ever think that football could also give you a brain disease.""'Mitigating potential risks'A study conducted by the University of Glasgow last year revealed that deaths from neurodegenerative disease are around three-and-a-half times higher among former football players than expected.  Players are also twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease, approximately four times as likely to develop motor neuron disease and five times as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.      According to Dr. Willie Stewart, a consultant neuropathologist and part of the team that compiled last year's study, the findings suggest football's approach to heading and head injuries needs to change.  ""I think if football doesn't change, we could be looking down the line and saying the Liverpool football team that won the championship in 2020, putting a ring around four or five of them saying that, unfortunately, these guys passed away with neurodegenerative disease because that's the kind of level we're talking about,"" Dr. Stewart tells CNN Sport.  ""Unfortunately, because of the numbers we brought forward last year, having five players from a team in 1966 ... with neurodegenerative disease is in line, unfortunately, with our statistics."" The Charlton brothers, Jack (left) and Bobby, were both part of England's victorious 1966 World Cup team.The Football Association (FA) and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), along with the Irish and Scottish FAs, ruled out heading in practice for players aged 11 and under to ""mitigate any potential risks"" that might be linked with heading the ball.  This was guided by the results of last year's study.In 2016, U.S. Soccer banned any heading for under-11s, while European governing body UEFA issued heading guidelines for young players earlier this year but stopped short of any form of ban. However, Dr. Stewart thinks work needs to be done on an international scale: ""I don't see a global game approach -- I see a global game approach to not doing anything,"" he says.  ""FIFA have not been in touch (following last year's study). FIFA have not taken forward this result, FIFA have not made any statement that they're going to do something. ""This is a big sport, it's the world's most popular participation sport. Taking the research forward is going to improve lifelong health and reduce the risk of dementia.""JUST WATCHEDLegend looks into football's link to dementiaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegend looks into football's link to dementia 03:47In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesperson said: ""As far as brain injuries in football are concerned, FIFA takes its responsibility very seriously as protecting the health of players is -- and will remain -- a top priority in developing the game. ""FIFA has made tackling this issue a key objective of its medical subdivision and has established an Independent Football Concussion Advisory Group that will further discuss and evaluate research on the topic of concussion and brain injuries. ""This group will work hand-in-hand with FIFA's medical subdivision, which in parallel will liaise with the Concussion Expert Group (CEG) to advise on adapting the Laws of the Game, to ensure the wellbeing of all players."" It has also been proposed that trials of additional permanent concussion substitutes could begin in January 2021.  Jack Charlton (left) and his brother Bobby (right) celebrate England's 1996 World Cup final win.'We shouldn't relax' Dr. Stewart also notes the case of Marius Zaliukas, a former defender for clubs in Scotland, England and his native Lithuania, who died 11 days before his 37th birthday having been diagnosed with motor neuron disease, according to his former football club Hearts.""I think it just highlights to me that whilst a lot of people will look at the weekend and talk about Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton and think about dementia, we're really talking not just about elderly, older men with dementia,"" says Dr. Stewart. New study to monitor ex-soccer stars for early signs of dementia ""We're talking about young men with problems as well. And I don't think we should lose sight of that. And we shouldn't relax and say this problem's from a bygone era."" Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) -- a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head traumas -- has a well-established association with contact sports, most notably in the NFL. When it comes to football, signs point towards heading as the aspect of the game causing CTE to develop in players' brains.  ""It's not from concussions because concussions are a rare event in football,"" says Dr. Stewart. ""But head impacts are a very common event in football -- heading is part of the game, heading in training is part of the game.

England captain Bobby Moore kisses the Jules Rimet trophy as the team celebrates winning the 1966 World Cup final.Support for former players The PFA has set up a dementia helpline to provide support for ex-players and, along with The Sporting Memories Foundation, has produced a guide to living with dementia.Sporting Memories is the world's first charity dedicated to using sports-based reminiscence to tackle social isolation, low mood and dementia among older adults. Many of the members are former professional or amateur footballers for whom remembering their playing days can help combat some of the effects of dementia, such as memory loss and cognitive impairment. UK football authorities ban children from heading footballs in training Sporting memorabilia -- footballs, photos, sticker albums or team kits -- can play an important role. ""Being able to share memories of playing football or playing other sports, they're the memories which are really powerful and often they're very positive memories as well -- feelings of when you were fit and able and running around and all the great conversations in the changing rooms and on the pitch,"" Chris Wilkins, co-founder of Sporting Memories, tells CNN Sport.  ""We've got our own retro ball that we bring along to the groups as well; the smell and the feel of all these things, they all tap into those long-term memories.   ""It's amazing what's triggered. People with quite advanced conditions can suddenly remember a specific game or the entire squad; how a goal was scored or what the weather was like."" There are now over 120 Sporting Memories clubs in England, Wales and Scotland which organize activities such as quizzes, discussions or gentle exercise that help spark positive memories.  The foundation works with football clubs across the UK to support former players who have been diagnosed with dementia.  ""It really is about the individual, because there are lots of forms of dementia and everybody's diagnosis -- and how they present with a diagnosis -- is different,"" says Wilkins. ""It's about looking at the individual in front of you and playing to their strengths -- what cognitive strengths they still have, what issues they have, and just trying to engage them and to make them feel comfortable and part of the group.""

Hong Kong's new rules have created confusion in the classroom. Some parents are pulling their children out,"Sarah is preparing to emigrate from Hong Kong, her birthplace and home, to the United Kingdom because she is concerned about her 8-year-old son's education. ""I want him to grow up in an environment with enough freedom to do what he wants to do and not be restricted by some invisible threat,"" said Sarah, who requested CNN use a pseudonym for fear of being targeted by authorities.In June, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that bans secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with foreign powers. The law was passed to quell the pro-democracy movement that destabilized the financial hub last year, but its reach went far beyond policing protests to criminalizing certain conversations, political positions, publications and even social media posts.In Hong Kong's classrooms, it is now unclear what can legally be taught or discussed.The Education Bureau has ordered schools to remove books and teaching materials that could violate the law. Administrators can call the police if someone insults the Chinese anthem, which must be played in schools on certain holidays. In September, a student who displayed a photo with the slogan ""Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now"" during class was suspended for a week. Read MoreSarah's move isn't just for her son: she is a teacher in Hong Kong. The English Schools Foundation, an international education organization, released new guidelines in September for teachers, seen by CNN, which concluded that the classroom ""is not a safe space"" for discussion or debate. It advised teachers to ""always be aware of how what you are teaching could be interpreted/misinterpreted by others."" The former Chief Executive of Hong Kong has even posted on his Facebook page personal details of teachers charged over professional misconduct during the protest last year.   Former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying speaks to the media after a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone on October 14, 2020, in Hong Kong, China.In Hong Kong, Sarah owns an apartment and a car -- both rare privileges in a city where buying a home is expensive and taking public transport is the norm. But she's prepared to give it all up for an uncertain life away from family and friends.  ""We will do any kind of job. Be a cleaner, do the dishes, be a cashier,"" she said. ""Because it's the value we place on the freedom that's more important than the materialistic life we have.""CNN spoke to several parents who said they were also preparing to move abroad for their children's education, and teachers at some schools have reported a higher than normal drop-out rate this year. One mother, who has two children in local primary schools, said her family will move to the UK before the end of the year. Like Sarah, she isn't sure what her job prospects will be in a country that's struggling to cope with a rapid rise in coronavirus cases.""We are sacrificing a lot to move. It will be expensive,"" she said. ""We want our children to study in a country that offers more freedom.""""Illegal ideas"" Last month, Hong Kong authorities took away a teacher's registration for life for allegedly ""spreading the idea of Hong Kong independence"" in class. Authorities did not give details about the classroom discussion, but local media reported that the teacher showed students a TV documentary, featuring pro-independence figure Andy Chan. They were then asked to answer questions from a worksheet about freedom of speech and proposals for Hong Kong independence. In response to the incident, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said ""illegal ideas"" and ""pro-independence"" concepts cannot exist in schools. Beijing has long blamed the Hong Kong education system for radicalizing its students. In particular, pro-Beijing lawmakers condemn Liberal Studies -- a required high school civics course that was introduced in 2009 to strengthen critical thinking and knowledge of contemporary issues. It covers topics including modern China, political participation and Hong Kong identity.  Pro-Beijing voices have criticized the course materials for being biased and encouraging students to join anti-government protests. Publishers of textbooks for the course have rewritten parts of it, removing criticism of the Chinese government and the term ""separation of powers."" Pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip.Pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip says the changes to education will teach students a more balanced history of China, rather than stifle conversation. ""The basic purpose is to bring up our children to at least have proper respect for our country,"" Ip said. ""I have received complaints about teachers using the classroom as a vehicle of the political beliefs, even stirring up hatred of police, of the Chinese government, of the people of China, portraying them as dirty, backward, repressive.""Education authorities received 247 misconduct complaints about teachers who allegedly ""disseminated hate remarks"" and ""advocated violence on social media,"" from last June to this August. Earlier this month, the Hong Kong education minister said his department had investigated several teachers and students for allegedly bullying the children of police officers, who were on the frontlines of last year's protests. According to local media reports, a secondary school teacher's contract was terminated because she allowed students to perform pro-democracy anthem ""Glory to Hong Kong."" According to Ip, the song ""amounts to sowing the seeds of Hong Kong independence in young minds."" This summer, the city's Education Bureau issued new guidelines, requiring Hong Kong schools to play the Chinese anthem during important holidays, and to report to the police those who insult the song. Ip says ""many countries"" teach their kids to memorize the constitution and sing the national anthem. ""I think there is no basic difference,"" she added.Joshua Wong  speaks to tens of thousands protesters outside government headquarters in Hong Kong, Saturday, Sept. 8, 2012.  For years, Beijing has tried to impose patriotic education in Hong Kong. Joshua Wong, a prominent Hong Kong activist and former leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, created a student activist group called Scholarism when he was in high school. In 2012, he rallied 120,000 people to occupy the Hong Kong government's headquarters to protest a Beijing-backed plan to introduce patriotic, pro-Communist national and moral education lessons in the city's public schools. Protesters argued the changes amounted to brainwashing, and their actions forced the city's beleaguered leaders to withdraw the proposed curriculum.That was the last time the students of Hong Kong won against Beijing.Since 2012, one of Beijing's primary aims has been to create a generation of patriotic and loyal Hong Kong youth, according to Lester Shum, onetime deputy secretary-general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students and now an elected lawmaker. He said the current changes could create a new generation who will be ""totally brainwashed, not knowing about the wrongdoings from the authorities.""But Shum says it's unclear how successful those aims will be, since students can still access free information from the internet and the press.  Next generationRowena He, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, has witnessed these types of changes to an education system play out before. In the spring of 1989, millions took to the streets in Beijing and other cities across China to demand political reforms. The nationwide movement ended on June 4, when the People's Liberation Army opened fire on its own people Beijing's city center. After that, the Communist Party launched a patriotic education campaign to instil national pride and change young people's attitudes towards Western powers. Today, few young people within mainland China know about the Tiananmen massacre, or pro-democracy protests, because the event is censored from the Chinese internet and books, and is not taught in schools. Many of those who know about the incident believe in the official version that the crackdown was necessary for China's stability and rise. But in Hong Kong it will take far longer to ""brainwash the younger generation,"" He said. ""Hong Kong has a strong civil society,"" she explained.He is the author of ""Tiananmen Exiles: Voices of the Struggle for Democracy in China."" For years, she taught seminars on the movement in American universities before moving to Hong Kong last year. She was looking forward to attending the June 4 commemoration for the first time in Hong Kong, the only place on Chinese soil where an annual vigil is held. But authorities banned the event in June for the first time in 30 years, citing coronavirus concerns. Many fear it will never take place again. A smaller crowd of people still gathered in Victoria Park this year, leading to the arrest of dozens of democracy activists who were accused of knowingly taking part in an ""unauthorized assembly.""Students at the patriotic Heung To Middle School in Hong Kong watch as Cheung Kit-yuk, center, and Chiu Pak-min, far left,  raise the Chinese national flag to the sounds of the national anthem during a ceremony in the school grounds, Friday, April 2, 2004. He still teaches her students about the Tiananmen massacre and historical episodes deemed taboo by the Communist Party, but fears of repercussions have followed her throughout her career.  In July, the University of Hong Kong fired Benny Tai, a prominent law professor and pro-democracy activist, who said academic staff in the city ""are no longer free to make controversial statements."" Local media have reported instances of professors with pro-democracy views whose contracts have been denied.""We never know what the red line is, that's the root of censorship and self-censorship,"" Rowena He said.On June 4 this year, He took her students to a replica of the ""Goddess of Democracy"" standing at the heart of the Chinese University campus. The original Goddess of Democracy was a 10-meter tall statue hastily made by students in 1989 that was destroyed by the Chinese military in Tiananmen Square. The figure is now a global symbol of defiance. Protesters sit next to a Goddess of Democracy statue at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in Hong Kong on November 12, 2019. ""Those in power can easily manipulate history and erase memory,"" He said. ""I try my best to speak out the truth -- that's the resistance.""Some of Rowena's students plan to leave Hong Kong after graduation. One of them, Tyler, who asked to use a pseudonym to avoid repercussions, said he will move to the UK to pursue graduate studies in Chinese history, because of the ""censorship problems"" in Hong Kong. ""The narrative in Hong Kong and China is quite controlled,"" he said.  Tyler took part in student demonstrations at the Chinese University of Hong Kong last year, which became the center of violent clashes between police and protesters. Students set up barricades against police who fired tear gas. Protesters were arrested in large numbers. ""Under the security law, many of us are afraid of being spied on by police,"" Tyler said. ""So now we are quite worried, but I still saw a lot of students who are willing to sacrifice themselves.""Some students are determined to stay in Hong Kong. One of Tyler's classmates plans to become a primary school teacher, so she can keep alive the memory of important events, such as the 1989 crackdown.""We need someone to continue to teach the next generation and continue to tell them what is right and wrong, so not just let them to be brainwashed by the government,"" said the student, who didn't want to be named for fear of being targeted by authorities.But Sarah, the teacher who is moving her family to the UK, does not want to wait to see what happens to the next generation. Her biggest fear isn't what's happening in Hong Kong currently, but what could happen in decades to come. By leaving Hong Kong now, she's hoping her son won't have to face a difficult decision in the future about whether to abandon the only city he knows.

Elon Musk's 'Teslas in a tunnel' project takes step forward in Las Vegas,"The Boring Company's project in Las Vegas was supposed to be the first real demonstration of Elon Musk's vision for re-imagining public transportation in cities. Musk, who has criticized traditional public transit such as subways, contended he could do much better. He tweeted out visions in 2018 of glass pods, picking up relaxed passengers from thousands of stations the size of single parking spaces that blend into cities, and said it would look ""a bit"" like that. While more images are still to come, so far the rendered reality is turning out wildly differently.Transportation experts say that images of Musk's system that were released last week reflect failures to surmount basic issues that subways solved long ago. They caution that the design for his stations accommodating multiple vehicles appears to show significant drawbacks, such as inefficient use of space and what appears to be a level of inaccessibility for the disabled. However, they note that every detail of a project isn't necessarily going to be included in a rendering, so it may not show the full scope of the project. More renderings are likely to surface as The Boring Company goes through more city reviews. ""These feel like the kind of renderings an architecture student would do for their one-semester project,"" Christof Spieler, a lecturer at Rice University who researches transit and urban planning, told CNN Business. ""I don't see any evidence that this has really been thought through in terms of how it would function.""Loop is intended to be a high-speed public transportation system that's more like underground layers of highways than a subway system. Teslas would whisk passengers through tunnels at speeds up to 155 mph. The Boring Company received the approval of the Las Vegas Planning Commission Tuesday night to build part of Loop, its intracity transportation service, in the city. It will seek the city council's approval next month. Read MoreThe company already completed two one-mile long tunnels on the grounds of the Las Vegas Convention Center in May. It hopes to expand the system throughout Las Vegas, with close to 50 stations at casinos and other attractions, according to a map the company has posted. The system at the convention center is scheduled to open in January 2021.  The company has a $48 million contract with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to complete the work. Spieler said Loop's renderings don't show a ""station"" in a conventional sense; instead, they appear to show taxi-like loading areas. He cautioned that issues would likely arise such as cars jockeying past each other to pull in and out, and people walking out into the roadway to board both sides of the Teslas. This could impact how smoothly the system operates as ridership grows. The Boring Company has said it envisions 4,000 vehicles an hour moving through each main artery tunnel in the system. That would give a maximum capacity of approximately 16,000 riders per hour when paired with a human driver with a Model 3 and 24,000 in a Model X, compared to the 10,000 to 25,000 riders per hour of traditional bus or rail transit systems, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials.  Using The Boring Company's tunnels to move people in low-capacity vehicles like sedans and SUVs is ""comically inefficient,"" according to Gerry Tierney, who co-directs the mobility lab at Perkins&Will, which has designed transit stations in North America and the Middle East.  ""This is not a transit system. It's a system for driving electric vehicles underground,"" said Tierney, adding that it would be as if one of the world's largest transit systems, such as the London Underground, replaced all of its subway trains with cars. A standard airport people mover, which has been mainstream since the 1970s, would board more quickly than the Loop system, Spieler said, as there's no need to duck and sit as you enter. A passenger can also hold on to their luggage, rather than accessing a trunk.""It seems like car-thinking applied to a transit problem that we already know how to solve,"" Spieler said. Musk described Loop last month as ""basically just Teslas in tunnels, which is way more profound than it sounds."" He did not elaborate on why this was profound. He did say in September that ""Tunnels under cities with self-driving electric cars will feel like warp drive."" The smaller-scale Loop appears to have grown out of the Hyperloop, Musk's plan for a 600 mph train in a tunnel for intercity transportation, which has yet to come to fruition. The Boring Company hopes Loop will one day reach 155 mph and use autonomous Teslas, though the project will initially use human drivers and will be capped at 35mph, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority CEO Steve Hill has said. The renderings also do not appear to show any barriers that would block an unauthorized car from entering the tunnel, Spieler said. However, final projects usually end up looking different than the conceptual renderings.  Elon Musk's tunnel project hit a milestone. But the future is unclear.One conceptual rendering shows a set of steps leading to a station, where the Teslas are boarded. Spieler said the renderings don't appear to give any thought to people in wheelchairs. The Boring Company did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including whether accessibility features would be part of the project. Elon Musk also did not respond to requests for comment for this story.A Las Vegas spokeswoman said its planning department will monitor whether there's enough parking spaces for the disabled. City staff could recommend that the city council not approve the project, if code requirements aren't met. An architectural review, environmental review and other reviews will examine if the project complies with all code requirements. ""Accommodations for the [disabled] will not be overlooked,"" she said. The company is seeking approval to build tunnels that are 4.6 miles long, and predominantly under city of Las Vegas rights of way, according to The Boring Company's permit application. The tunnels will be about 30 feet below ground, the application says. The Boring Company's permit request to expand Loop in Las Vegas is technically for a monorail, although the system isn't one. Las Vegas regulations for monorails aren't technology specific, according to a city staff report on The Boring Company's application, so the Loop system can be classified as a monorail. (Las Vegas already has a traditional monorail system operating in the city.)  The Boring Company's ambitions appear to extend outside Las Vegas, however. It's already pursuing projects in Los Angeles and on the East Coast. It promoted jobs in in Austin, Texas, which will be home to a new Tesla factory, less than a week after Austin voters passed a $7.1 billion plan to expand the growing city's transit network. There are no indications that Tesla will be involved in the project.",2020-11-16T16:13:59Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/cars/boring-company-vegas-elon-musk/index.html,2020-11-17 10:20:14.501804,CNN,travel,0

Nicklaus Snr. laughed and told Lyle.""Jack said to me, 'Hear what he just said? What about my old heart?'"" said Lyle.

""Jack Nicklaus has 200 yards and he's never needed an eagle more,"" whispered CBS commentator Ben Wright in his polished English brogue. After much mulling with Jackie, Nicklaus opted for a four iron and stroked the ball over the water, stopping it in the heart of the narrow putting surface, safe from the slick slope behind. A roar rose up from the packed galleries around the green and broke like a wave up the fairway. ""And he's got a very, very good chance,"" said Wright, with a hint of excitement.    On the green, Nicklaus and Jackie stalked the putt, surveying it from every angle. When the din had subsided, he took his hunched stance and rolled it through the shadows and into the hole for an eagle three. Jackie leapt into the air. The thunderous roar told the story. Hope and belief surged for the old favourite. Now just two strokes back. ""Yes, Sir!"" urged Wright. ""The battle is joined. My goodness. There is life in the old Bear yet. Magnificent stuff.""  ""That's when I began to think something was really occurring,"" said Lyle, who was leaning on his putter as Nicklaus' ball dropped yards in front of him. ""The eagle lit a fuse and got the crowd going unbelievably and they never stopped from there to the 18th."" Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosThe Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April, although it is being held in November in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It's a spring rite, steeped in tradition and layered in rich sporting history and drama. It's an event that attracts even non-golfers because of the sublime beauty of the course. Click through the gallery for an A-Z of the Masters.Hide Caption 1 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosA is for Augusta National – The revered course has hosted the year's opening major -- and the only one of the big four events to be played at the same course every year -- since 1934. A is also for the azaleas which traditionally blossom during Masters week and for Amen Corner, the infamous stretch of holes incorporating the 11th, the treacherous short 12th and the tee shot on the par-five 13th. Hide Caption 2 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosB is for Beauty – The Georgian greensward is an oasis among the urban landscape of Augusta, Georgia's second city on the banks of the Savannah River. The bars, burger joints and shopping malls of neighboring Washington Road are in stark contrast to the golfing dreamscape over the fence. B is also for Seve Ballesteros, the Spaniard who opened the European floodgates with wins in 1980 and 1983.    Hide Caption 3 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosC is for Caddies – Augusta's caddies are instantly recognizable by their white jump suits. Before 1983, players had to use a club caddie, all of whom were local black men. Since then players have used their usual tour caddies, but they must still don the white suit and green cap. Hide Caption 4 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosD is for Dos and Don'ts – The hallowed property is governed by its own strict rules such as no running or cell phones, but on the flip side traditions exist such as the practice of placing your green Masters chair at your preferred spot and being able to return to your vacant seat hours later.Hide Caption 5 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosE is for Eisenhower – Former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a member of  Augusta National and several landmarks of his era remain, including Ike's Pond, the fishing lake he championed that is the focal point of the Par-3 Contest. Eisenhower's white cabin also sits near the clubhouse.Hide Caption 6 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosF is for Fans (make that Patrons) – Visitors to Augusta National are known as patrons -- not fans or spectators or the crowd. Tickets are like gold dust, but a limited number of practice round tickets and tournament days are available through a yearly ballot. The waiting list for weekly tournament badges closed years ago.Hide Caption 7 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosG is for Grand Slam – Rory McIlroy just needs the Masters to complete the Grand Slam of all four of golf's major titles. The Northern Irishman blew a four-shot lead at Augusta in 2011, but having won four majors in the meantime returns for his fifth shot at the Grand Slam this week. Only five others have achieved the feat -- Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. G is also for greens -- the slick, sloping putting surfaces are infamous. Hide Caption 8 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosH is for History – Augusta National was created by Scottish golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie and co-founder Bobby Jones and opened in 1933 on land that was once the site of Fruitlands Nursery. During World War II the land was briefly given over to turkey and cattle farming. Hide Caption 9 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosI is for Internationals – South African Gary Player -- pictured here in 2014 with Jack Nicklaus (left) and the late Arnold Palmer -- was the first international champion in 1961. Since then the Masters has been won 21 times by overseas players. The US counts for 60 wins from 37 different players.Hide Caption 10 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosJ is for Jacket, as in green – The tropical-weight emerald blazer is worn by only Augusta National members and Masters champions. It was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club.Hide Caption 11 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosK is for Key holes – The saying goes the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday. It starts with one of the hardest holes on the course in the 10th and then enters Amen Corner with the equally tough 11th and then the booby trap of the short 12th. But the long 15th (pictured) is key -- big moves can be made with eagles here. Anything less than a birdie and you will likely go backwards. Hide Caption 12 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosL is for Lane, as in Magnolia Lane – The exclusive driveway to Augusta's historic clubhouse is framed by dozens of magnolia trees. Only members and Masters competitors are allowed to access this revered entrance which gives on to the Founder's Circle and then the whitewashed concrete clubhouse, built in 1854. Hide Caption 13 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosM is for Mickelson – Popular left-hander Phil Mickelson is one of 17 players to have won multiple Masters titles. The three-time champion won the first of his five major titles at Augusta in 2004 after three straight third places. Even at 50, Mickelson remains a Masters threat. Hide Caption 14 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosN is for Nicklaus, as in Jack  – The most successful player at the Masters is Jack Nicklaus, whose six Green Jackets remains the record. The 80-year-old is now an honorary starter along with Gary Player, following the death of four-time champion Arnold Palmer in 2016. Hide Caption 15 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosO is for Oak tree – The famous old oak tree on the course side of the clubhouse is an iconic landmark and the traditional meeting place for the game's movers and shakers and media types with the correct credential. A familiar refrain of Masters week is: ""Meet you under the tree.""Hide Caption 16 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosP is for Par 3s, notably the 12th  – Perhaps the most famous short hole in golf, the par-3 12th sits at the heart of Amen Corner. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, it is just 155 yards long, but Rae's Creek looms large in front and a devilish wind always swirling around the trees makes club selection tricky.Hide Caption 17 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosQ is for Quonset Hut – Modern media are housed in a recently built state-of-the-art facility at the far end of the practice range, but in days gone by the stories from Augusta were crafted in a corrugated metal Quonset Hut.  Hide Caption 18 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosR is for Roars – When the excitement rises on a Sunday afternoon and the patrons reach fever pitch, the roars reverberate around the towering pines which act like a giant organ reflecting the noise all over the course. A Phil Mickelson roar stands out, but a roar for Tiger Woods is like no other.  Hide Caption 19 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosS is for Spieth – Jordan Spieth was on a fast track to being crowned the new king of Augusta following his wire-to-wire victory in 2015 and dominance for three rounds in 2016. He was still clear with nine holes to play before famously self destructing with two balls in the water on 12. The American has struggled of late and is down to 33rd in the world, but in five Masters appearances he has won, finished second twice, come third and 11th.Hide Caption 20 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosT is for Tradition – The Masters is forward looking but rooted in tradition, such as the pre-tournament Par-3 Contest, in which friends and family members caddie for the players and hit the occasional shot. Jack Nicklaus' grandson Gary made a hole in one last year. Other traditions include the Champions Dinner, in which the holder chooses the menu and hosts the evening on the Tuesday of Masters weekHide Caption 21 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosU is for Under par – When Jordan Spieth won in 2015 he equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record for the lowest winning score at 18 under par.  Hide Caption 22 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosV is for Views – Augusta's vistas are consistently spell-binding with the pines framing the holes and the lush grass, ice white of the bunkers and explosions of color from the flowers and patrons adding to the allure.   Hide Caption 23 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosW is for Woods – Who else? Tiger Woods changed golf when he won his first major by a record 12 shots in 1997. He went on to win three further Green Jackets, the last of which came in 2005 after a famous chip-in on the 16th. The  43-year-old is fit again after multiple back surgeries, and among the widely tipped contenders.  Hide Caption 24 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosX is for X-factor – Winning the Masters requires a game in mint condition and a bit of something special. Think Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th in 2005, or Phil Mickelson's shot threaded through trees on the 13th in 2010. Or what about Bubba Watson's banana ball from the woods on the 10th to clinch a play off in 2012 (pictured)? Hide Caption 25 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosY is for Youngest winner – Tiger Woods' 1997 win for the first of 14 majors so far made him the youngest Masters champion at the age of 21.Hide Caption 26 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photosZ is for Zenith – For many players, winning the Masters represents the zenith of their career. Phil Mickelson's jump for joy in 2004 at his 11th attempt kick started an era which yielded further victories in 2006 and 2010.  Hide Caption 27 of 27As Nicklaus stood in deep shadow on the 16th tee, debutant CBS announcer Jim Nantz asked his summarizer Tom Weiskopf what would be going through his mind. ""If I knew the way he thought I would have won this tournament,"" said Weiskopf, the 1973 British Open champion.Nicklaus made his swing, the ball soared towards the green, took two hops and then checked and span left, trickling down the slope to three feet below the hole.The pines, acting like the reeds in a giant mouth organ, amplified the roar. Once the clamor had died down Nicklaus sank the putt for birdie. One back. ""The noise was quadrophonic, coming from above, from the side -- I think even God was laughing,"" added Lyle.""The Bear has come out of hibernation,"" purred Nantz.David Cannon took this image of Jack Nicklaus hitting out of a bunker at the 1986 Masters. 'Seve or Jack?'Behind them, Ballesteros was swashbuckling his way down the 15th.Veteran golf photographer David Cannon was following the Spaniard, his favorite player. Ballesteros would later have Cannon's iconic image of his 1984 Open victory at St Andrews tattooed on his arm, but now Cannon was wracked with indecision.   ""I was following Seve and hearing these epic roars around the course,"" he told CNN. ""Follow Seve or go with Jack? I literally changed direction 10 times.  Luckily my brain said, 'hang on, this is the greatest golfer there's ever been and this is his chance to win another major. You have to go there.'""Cannon diverted from the 15th fairway to wait for Nicklaus behind the 17th. But a huge groan came from down in the valley to his left. Ballesteros, his head bowed in his white visor, had dunked his second into the water on 15.  Nicklaus, on the 17th tee, sensed what had occurred from the roar -- groans mixed with cheers.His drive drifted left into trees and he had given himself a tricky second shot. Still, he found the green and had about a 12 footer for birdie.JUST WATCHEDTiger Woods' ideal day: 'Caddyshack,' oatmeal?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTiger Woods' ideal day: 'Caddyshack,' oatmeal? 01:35Augusta loreCannon lined up behind a little ridge, hoping desperately no one would get in his way.On the green, Nicklaus and Jackie consulted over the putt. Jackie thought the putt would break right but his dad wasn't so sure.Nicklaus recalled the Augusta lore that all putts break towards Rae's Creek, the stream that runs in front of the 12th green and is the lowest part of the course. ""You sure?"" asked Jackie.""'Pretty sure. I think it will come back to the left because of Rae's Creek,'"" he later recalled. ""'There's always that influence back there.'""Nicklaus barely stroked his putt, starting it left before the ball veered to the right and then, sure enough, straightened back up as it neared the hole.  ""Maybe,"" said CBS announcer Verne Lundquist. Nicklaus dropped a knee and raised his left arm in the air with his putter as if to chase the ball into the hole. ""Yes, Sir,"" shouted Lundquist as the ball dropped. Nicklaus' double arm pump punctuated the word ""Sir.""Cannon fired away as the ball dropped. Nicklaus' raised arm has become another of golf's most iconic images. ""I could see Jack clearly. I had a lovely background with the sun at a beautiful angle and it made an amazing picture,"" said Cannon, who faced a nervous wait until his shots were developed back in the UK the following Tuesday. ""The relief and excitement was staggering,"" he added.Jack Nicklaus holed a birdie putt on the 17th to take the lead in the 1986 Masters.'Oh, beautiful'""Gone, done"" Nicklaus was now the sole leader of the Masters and Augusta was fizzing. Nicklaus emerged from the maelstrom onto the 18th tee. Digging deep, he unleashed his final drive through the narrow chute of trees and found the fairway.His second shot from 175 yards came to rest on the bottom tier of the back-to-front sloping green, and he walked up to the final hole through an ear-ringing standing ovation.  ""In all my years in golf that to me was most the emotional and largest ovation I have ever heard,"" he said.Nicklaus' first putt came to rest a few feet from the hole and he drained his next for a par four to seal a blistering back nine of 30 and give him the clubhouse lead at nine under. He shook hands with Lyle and his caddie Dave Musgrove and embraced Jackie. The pair walked off the green with their arms around each other's shoulders. ""Oh, beautiful,"" said CBS commentator Ken Venturi.

Can Biden's climate change agenda break the 'brown blockade'?,"President-elect Joe Biden has committed more explicitly than any nominee before him to dramatic steps against the climate crisis, but he faces the same geographic puzzle that has precluded congressional action on the challenge for years. Although Biden won the popular vote by a margin well over 5 million and expanded the Democrats' Electoral College map, he still confronted an impregnable wall of opposition from the states most tightly integrated into the fossil fuel economy, a CNN analysis of the results has found. Biden dominated the largely post-industrial states, many of them along the two coasts, that generate the least amount of carbon emissions per dollar of economic activity, according to figures from the federal Energy Information Administration. Biden TransitionPeople of color make up nearly half of Biden transition teamSeven Trump health care measures that Biden will likely overturnFauci: 'It would be better' if government health officials could start working with incoming Biden-Harris administrationMAP: Full election resultsBut as in 2016, President Donald Trump won almost all of the states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output, a measure that tracks which states rely most on fossil fuels, either as producers or consumers. Equally important, those states overwhelmingly sent to the Senate Republicans who almost indivisibly oppose federal action to reduce the carbon emissions linked to global climate change. After ousting one Democratic incumbent (Doug Jones in Alabama) and fending off well-funded challenges in several other states (including Montana, Iowa, South Carolina, Texas and Alaska), Republicans now hold 37 of the 42 Senate seats in the 21 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output. Read MoreDemocrats, in turn, after beating Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado, hold at least 36 of the Senate seats in the 21 states with the least carbon-intensive economies, with two seats in Georgia yet to be decided in January runoffs. The eight states clustered around the national average for carbon emissions per dollar of gross domestic product split narrowly, with Republicans holding nine of their Senate seats and Democrats seven.Joe Biden's climate plan could put Paris Agreement targets 'within striking distance,' experts say  The GOP's dominant position in the high-carbon states means that Republicans, even if they lose control of the Senate in the Georgia runoffs, can sustain a filibuster against climate action almost solely with senators from the states most invested in the existing fossil fuel economy -- a dynamic that I've called the ""brown blockade."" This increasing alignment of red and blue with brown and green ensures an explosive collision as Biden takes office determined to reverse Trump's dismissive approach to the climate crisis.""I have no doubt that he [Biden] feels like he has a mandate to take climate action and his team does,"" says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environmental policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, who was a top environmental official under President Barack Obama. ""He is coming out of the gate addressing the issue on day one.""Even in the shadow of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the associating economic upheaval, Biden discussed climate change more than any previous nominee and certainly committed to the most ambitious plan of any President-elect to confront it. At the second presidential debate, Biden forthrightly acknowledged, ""I would transition from the oil industry,"" as part of the long-term evolution to a carbon-free economy. Under intense fire from Trump and other Republicans, Biden clarified that statement to indicate that he was talking about a long-term change that would unfold over decades -- and that he would not ban fracking for natural gas on private land in the meantime. But he did not renounce his commitments to the transition itself. And to experts that marks a new era in the long-stalemated debate over climate.""We are far closer to taking climate change seriously, because for the first time one of our major political parties ... now sees climate change as one of the absolute top issues,"" says Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. ""That simply was not the case 12 months ago. Period, bold, underlined, exclamation point. That will have consequences.""The 'brown blockade'In particular, Biden will take the debate into a new stage by requiring virtually every agency in the federal government to factor it into its plans. Goldfuss, the managing director of the Council on Encvironmental Quality for Obama, recently helped lead the production of a report that underscored the opportunity for Biden to advance the transition to a low-carbon society across a wide spectrum of agencies.""President-elect Biden will be the first president that pursues a whole of government approach to climate change from day one,"" she says. ""What we outlined in 'Climate 21' was a strategy where you organize your agenda on climate change out of the White House ... and really make sure you are driving progress across your entire government. That is a very large body of work and there are a ton of tools at your disposal.""Robert McNally, who was a White House energy aide to President George W. Bush and now advises energy companies, uses the analogy of the unexpectedly successful offensive from the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War in 1968 to measure how aggressively he expects the new administration to reverse Trump's hands-off approach on climate. ""Biden using executive powers can unleash a Tet offensive onslaught against the oil and gas industry, and he will,"" McNally predicts.But for all of the opportunities available to Biden, experts note he faces two large obstacles. One is that many of his most ambitious proposals -- particularly to drastically increase spending on clean energy alternatives -- will require congressional action. And there he faces the same intractable geographic divide that has shelved any serious discussion of climate issues, particularly in the Senate.Solar CEO is relieved the next president isn't a climate denierJust as in the 2016 election, the states most invested in the fossil fuel economy predominantly sided with Republicans. Trump carried 10 of the 15 states that produce the most coal, 11 of the 15 that produce the most natural gas and 12 of the 15 that produce the most oil, according to EIA figures.The EIA's analysis of carbon emissions per dollar of economic activity offers the broadest measure of states' integration into the fossil fuel economy. The states at the top of that list tend to be large fossil fuel producers (such as Wyoming, West Virginia, Alaska and Texas) or to have robust agricultural and/or manufacturing sectors that are large consumers of those fuels (such as Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio and Indiana). The ones at the bottom are mostly coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Washington, Oregon and California (which does produce some natural gas).Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon per dollar of economic output, with New Mexico the sole exception. Biden won 19 of the 21 with the least emissions, with only Florida and North Carolina (narrowly) defying the trend. Biden made significant gains in the middle tier of eight states clustered around the national average for emissions per dollar of GDP, carrying five of them, including four that Trump won last time: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona. The Senate results, as noted above, largely follow these tracks, too.Opportunities and challengesBob Casey of Pennsylvania is one of the relatively few Senate Democrats (along with colleagues from West Virginia, Montana and Colorado) representing a state with a substantial energy sector (Pennsylvania ranks second in natural gas production, with a large fracking industry around Pittsburgh). In an interview, Casey said he was confident that he could sustain support for Biden's climate and energy agenda in the state, which the former vice president narrowly recaptured after Trump narrowly won it in 2016. ""I am comfortable with his approach and I think it's where most of the country is and frankly where most of the state is,"" Casey told me. Especially valuable, Casey said, is that Biden has framed the response to climate change as an economic as much as an environmental imperative and has accepted an extended transition from fossil fuels -- ""when you have a state like ours where gas extraction is such a prominent part of the economy that people can hold two concepts in their minds at the same time: One that we have to address climate change directly and have a sense of urgency about it, but also that we can have responsible gas extraction.""Gina McCarthy, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama and now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, also says Biden's emphasis on the potential economic benefits of responding to climate change could help broaden the coalition for action.In this September 21, 2018, file photo, Sen. Bob Casey addresses supporters at a campaign rally for statewide Democratic candidates in Philadelphia.""I think you are going to see Joe Biden move the climate agenda forward by not necessarily hitting people over the head with climate change,"" she told me. ""I think he's looking at these as investment opportunities, not punishments, not sacrifices. ... I think there's an opportunity here to talk in a way the American public will understand and not to divorce it from our need to keep people working and grow more jobs.""Biden's discipline in linking climate action with economic opportunity -- reiterated in his speech Monday on the economy -- is likely to help him align the relatively few Senate Democrats from energy-producing areas behind his plans. His problem is that there's no sign of cracks in the wall against climate action from the much larger number of Senate Republicans representing energy-producing areas. Biden's leverage to pressure those Republicans may be extremely limited because all of them represent states that backed Trump in the election. One energy lobbyist and former Trump administration official, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal conversations, says most Republicans from energy-producing states see the Biden climate agenda as an existential threat to their local economies. ""That's why the fault lines are going to remain where they are, if not harden,"" the lobbyist said. ""I don't see why any Republican would want to go along with a big climate bill whose purpose is to put their home state or their constituents out of business."" Opinion: America, we've missed you. Now please get your act together on climate changePlus, the lobbyist noted, after the success Republicans had tarring Democrats in energy-producing areas with the proposed ""Green New Deal,"" if the GOP maintains Senate control Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is unlikely to favor a climate bill that would allow Democrats to claim credit for a moderate bipartisan compromise.To many observers, the difficult Senate math facing Democrats -- largely because of their inability to dent the ""brown blockade"" in the election -- means that Biden is likely to lean heavily on regulatory action. McCarthy sees great opportunities to not only revive but also expand the two key Obama regulatory initiatives on climate that Trump has rescinded: the deal Obama reached with auto companies to significantly improve fuel efficiency, and his Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions from electrical power generation. McCarthy said a revised fuel economy standard could require the sale of only electric or other zero-emission cars by 2035 or 2040, and that an updated clean power plan, supported by complementary federal spending, could point the nation toward Biden's 2035 goal of zero-emission electricity generation. States and utilities, she says, already ""are recognizing that is the path to cheaper electricity and a healthier community and so that in combination with the budget can actually advance this [transition].""Then there are the courtsBut Biden faces a formidable obstacle in centering his climate agenda on regulation: the joint success of Trump and McConnell at confirming more than 200 federal judges, including three justices who have cemented a solid 6-3 Republican advantage on the Supreme Court. That Republican court majority has signaled it may not only resist new extensions of federal regulatory power but also also seek to roll back existing authority long upheld under a legal precedent known as the Chevron doctrine. Many observers believe this Supreme Court may even seek to retrench the landmark 5-4 decision in 2007 that upheld the EPA's authority to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. ""That new 6-3 Supreme Court is going to require Biden to play defense on foundational environmental law,"" says McNally.The Supreme Court might be even more ambitious in overturning environmental initiatives, some believe, if Republicans hold the Senate and effectively reassure the justices that Democrats could not enlarge the court in response to aggressive rulings.Two long-term changes may soften the resistance to climate action in some of the big fossil fuel states. One is that they are facing more consequences from the changing climate -- from hurricanes in the Southeast to wildfires in the West (though polling still shows most Republicans in those states do not attribute them to human-induced climate change). The other is that renewable energy production is growing as an economic force in many of those same places, with Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Kansas leading in wind production and solar output growing in highly contested purple states including Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina. Today, ""the fossil fuel industry holds ... a stranglehold over the Republican Party particularly in those [high-carbon] states, but that is going to change,"" says Leiserowitz. ""Many of the same states that are fossil fuel-producing states are also blessed with the most wind and solar and geothermal resources.""The question for Biden is whether those economic and political dynamics will change fast enough to loosen the Senate's brown blockade against climate action. The question for the country, and the world, may be: What are the consequences if it does not?",2020-11-17T05:06:56Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/biden-climate-change-agenda-senate/index.html,2020-11-17 10:37:32.738923,CNN,politics,0

New Zealand has just elected one of the most diverse parliaments in the world. Here's how it stacks up,"As two older, White, male candidates fought for supremacy in the United States election, New Zealand was offering its electorate a more progressive choice: two White women.But in New Zealand, that was just the start. When Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was reelected in a landslide last month, she brought with her a diverse cast of politicians that make up what is -- by some measures -- the most inclusive parliament in the world. Almost half of New Zealand's newly sworn-in Parliament are women and 11% are openly LGBTQ. Both New Zealand's Indigenous Māori and people with Pacific Island heritage are represented at a slightly higher rate than in the general population.


Politicians from diverse backgrounds aren't just making up numbers in Parliament -- they're in key positions of power. Read MoreEight of Ardern's 20-strong cabinet -- the highest-ranked lawmakers -- are also women, and a quarter are Māori. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson will be the first openly gay politician to hold that role in New Zealand. And foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta, who wears a moko kauae or traditional Māori face tattoo, is the first Indigenous woman in New Zealand's history to represent the country in that position. ""It looks like New Zealand looks,"" said Jennifer Curtin, a professor of politics and director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Auckland, of the country's government. ""We're not male, pale and stale anymore.""Here's what New Zealand's new Parliament looks likeNew Zealand already had a relatively diverse Parliament. Following the 2017 election, 38% of New Zealand's MPs were women -- a record in the country. Now it's 48%. The proportion of openly LGBTQ lawmakers has also increased from 7% to 11%.Māori representation has slipped, however, from 23% at the last election to 21%. That's the lowest level of Māori representation since 2014, but it is still higher than the total proportion of people who identify as Māori in the general population -- around 17%. 






Diversity in the New Zealand Parliament

Women
LGBTQ
Indigenous



Almost half are women, a record in New Zealand. Last election, 38% of MPs were women.
More than one out of 10 parliamentarians are openly LGBTQ, the highest proportion in New Zealand's history.
One fifth are Māori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. That's higher than the general population, but the lowest proportion in Parliament since 2014.


















New Zealand's Parliament has had Māori seats since 1867, soon after the country was founded, but these have sometimes been seen as tokenism. Until 1967, Māori candidates were only allowed to contest a limited number of Māori seats, and it was only in 1975 that Māori were able to choose whether they wanted to be on the Māori electoral roll. Kelvin Davis, who is Māori and the deputy leader of Ardern's center-left Labour Party, said he was happy with the level of Indigenous representation in New Zealand's Cabinet. ""I think (the level of representation in Cabinet) is a first ever and we're proud to be a part of that,"" he said, according to public broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ). Labour MP Louisa Wall, who is Māori and lesbian, says that the increase in LGBTQ representation will create an even more progressive society. New Zealand introduced same-sex civil unions in 2004, and in 2013, Wall spearheaded a bill to make same-sex marriage legal.  ""We have come a long way and for me it is about representative democracy. We reflect our larger New Zealand population,"" Wall said, according to RNZ.Curtin said that having a representative legislature meant there was a range of perspectives at the decision table. ""Diversity in itself is good,"" she said. ""Anything that disrupts the homogeneity and the dominance of the White majority, or the colonizers, of this place.""Here's how that stacks up globallyOut of thousands of active lawmakers across the globe, just 194 are openly gay in 42 countries, according to data collated by Andrew Reynolds, from the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.Of those countries, New Zealand now has the highest proportion of openly LGBTQ lawmakers, at 11%, according to his data. (Previously it was the United Kingdom, at 8%.)In New Zealand, 3.5% of adults identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or another sexual identity other than straight, according to a 2018 Statistics New Zealand survey of approximately 12,000 households. The surveyors, however, said the result ""may underestimate"" the true proportion as the data was collected via face-to-face interviews. When it comes to gender New Zealand doesn't have the highest proportion of women lawmakers in the world -- that title goes to Rwanda, where 61% of seats in the country's lower house are occupied by women. The country lost so many men during the 1994 genocide that women stepped in to fill key leadership roles.      But New Zealand's 48% female legislature is the highest of all OECD countries, alongside Mexico (where a 2014 law dictates gender parity in politics), and well above the global average of 25%.New Zealand's closest neighbor, Australia, only has 31% female representation in its lower house, while Pacific Island countries have an average of 6%. When it comes to the overall population, there are slightly more women than men in New Zealand -- globally there are slightly more men than women, according to the CIA World Factbook.  As for ethnic diversity, the country is still lacking when it comes to representation of Asian New Zealanders, for example, who make up 15% of the country's general population, but only hold 7% of seats in Parliament. But demographer Paul Spoonley, a professor at Massey University in Auckland, said a parliament didn't need to perfectly match the overall makeup of the general population to be representative -- although warned if it was too different the public might lose trust in their lawmakers.""I think it's really important that a political system represents the diversity including the ethnic diversity of a population, and that's because they bring that voice and experience,"" he said.      But there's still room for improvement The significance of all this is that New Zealand's Parliament looks more like the general population -- which in turn makes it more representative. But that doesn't mean it's perfect. While one in four New Zealanders have a disability -- defined by Statistics New Zealand as a long-term limitation in a person's ability to carry out daily activities -- Curtin said she was not aware of any MPs with disabilities. That's something disability advocate Jonny Wilkinson has also criticized, saying that the country's ""largest minority group"" still isn't represented. And Spoonley, the demographer, pointed out that diversity includes making sure a range of ages and socioeconomic backgrounds are represented. ""It's not a finished project,"" Curtin said. Not everyone in New Zealand is happy about Ardern's diverse Parliament. Right-wing blogger Olivia Pierson said Mahuta's moko kauae wasn't fitting for a foreign diplomat and that her appointment showed Ardern had ""gone full wokelette on stilts."" Nanaia Mahuta introduces Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape to guests at Parliament on February 24, 2020 in Wellington, New Zealand.While New Zealand may have a diverse Parliament now, there's no guarantee for the future. The country's right-leaning parties have less diverse representation than its left-leaning parties, so a switch in government in 2023 could mean a less inclusive Parliament. New Zealand's main opposition party, National, has only two Māori MPs and only 30% of its lawmakers are women. No current National MPs are openly LGBTQ.National leader Judith Collins -- who famously asked ""is there something wrong with being White?"" -- has dismissed concerns about diversity, arguing that her party has a ""diversity of thought."" Curtin says she hopes that there's a ""contagion effect"" where parties on the right decide to become more diverse so they can attract voters. ""We have seen ebbs and flows on the representation of women before,"" she said. ""It's not a given that this degree of diversity will hold beyond the next three years.""",2020-11-17T03:00:16Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/asia/new-zealand-parliament-diverse-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,2020-11-17 10:18:42.661679,CNN,politics,0
Trump aims to undermine Biden's legitimacy even as legal challenges fizzle,"When President Donald Trump learned at the end of last week that his lawyers were dropping their lawsuit seeking a review of ballots in Arizona, the news caught him by surprise. Summoning members of his team to the Oval Office, where he has been spending afternoons and evenings lately when not in the adjoining dining room watching television, Trump demanded to know why it appeared he was giving up a battle he fully intends to continue waging. Even as his legal pathway to challenging Joe Biden's electoral victory becomes thinner by the day -- and as some of his senior-most aides begin signaling publicly that Biden will take office in January -- Trump has shown little indication he plans to back off his false claim that he won the election.  Biden TransitionPeople of color make up nearly half of Biden transition teamSeven Trump health care measures that Biden will likely overturnFauci: 'It would be better' if government health officials could start working with incoming Biden-Harris administrationMAP: Full election resultsInstead of an actual attempt to locate more votes or even to reverse the election results, Trump's legal efforts appear designed instead to seed conspiracy theories among his conservative supporters, raise additional money, preserve power over the Republican Party and cast a pall of illegitimacy over Biden's tenure -- the same shadow Trump has long complained darkened his own time in office. Whether any of those outcomes is his express goal remains unclear. Many around him believe a dejected President is simply making an elaborate attempt at processing his trauma rather than executing a master plan. Asked last week how long his efforts might last, Trump suggested ""two weeks, three weeks"" -- though few believe he will ever acknowledge outright that he lost the election to Biden.Read MoreWithin the President's circle, two camps had already begun emerging prior to Thursday's meeting in the Oval Office, which included Vice President Mike Pence.Senior aides, including at the White House and on his campaign, had aligned with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter Ivanka in warning the President that his legal efforts amounted to a long shot that was exceedingly unlikely to change the outcome of the election.  But Trump was also hearing from his longtime lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump that the fight should continue and they could still win. They have argued the President owes it to his supporters -- including the thousands who marched in Washington this weekend -- to at least maintain the appearance that he is still in the fight. And they have floated ever-more-conspiratorial theories that could extend the fight. The split came to a head during the Oval Office huddle, a session people briefed on the matter described as contentious even by Trump administration standards. At one point, Giuliani -- who was patched in on speaker phone -- called the Trump campaign lawyers liars for telling the President his odds of changing the outcome of the election were slim. On the call, Justin Clark, the President's deputy campaign manager, fired back. ""F***ing asshole,"" Clark labeled the former New York City mayor, whose involvement in Trump's post-election legal efforts has caused anger and exasperation among other advisers.Clark declined to comment to CNN.By the end of the week, Trump had made clear whose side he was taking. Giuliani is now spearheading ""the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS,"" Trump declared on Twitter. Throughout the weekend, the President issued tweet after tweet using lies to question the election results, and quickly reversed what had seemed like an inadvertent nod to Biden's victory. ""I concede NOTHING!"" he blared on Sunday.Real-world consequencesTrump's refusal to concede has had widespread consequences, from his successor's inability to access federal money to the spread of new conspiracy theories among his hard-core supporters.  But the extension of his reelection fight has also provided new cause for his campaign and the Republican National Committee to bombard supporters with requests for funds, and has laid bare the strength of Trump's grip on Republican lawmakers, most of whom continue refusing to acknowledge his loss.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was silent Monday walking onto the Senate floor when questioned by CNN if he agreed with Trump's false claim, made earlier on Twitter, that he ""won the election."" While staffers inside the White House describe existing in a state of purgatory -- caught between a boss who refuses to admit defeat and the stark reality they'll be out of work in a matter of months -- Trump himself has only seen his post-presidency prospects become clearer, including the potential for launching a new media venture or the immediate announcement of a 2024 bid, both of which he's discussed in private over the past week.Some Republicans view the President's attempts at contesting the election as a way for him to continue stoking his supporters and holding sway over a fiercely loyal and reliable bloc of voters, whether he decides to run for president again in four years or not. By maintaining the falsehood the election was stolen from him, Trump is able to continue wielding power over the party that a losing candidate -- or at least a candidate who admitted losing -- could not. Crowds that gathered in Washington and other cities this weekend to protest the election results only seemed to lend fuel to the President's desire to keep fighting -- or at least to maintain the image that he wasn't defeated. After passing through the crowd in his motorcade on the way to his golf club in Virginia, Trump phoned his social media adviser Dan Scavino to marvel at the sight. Dan Eberhart, an Arizona-based energy executive and a Republican donor, said he's been invited to the Trump campaign's daily surrogate calls, during which campaign officials seek to explain the recount and legal strategy and ""keep hope alive."" But he listens in only every other day or so. Trump's reluctance to concede, Eberhart said, was becoming tiresome. ""I'm kind of over it,"" he said. ""I view the Trump world as a melting ice cube at the moment.""No sign of backing down At the start of last week, White House officials and presidential allies believed the President was simply demonstrating his fighting spirit as he steadfastly refused to concede and ordered up legal challenges in several states. Many assumed -- perhaps naively -- that Trump would eventually allow a transition to occur, once a recount in Georgia concluded and other states certified their results. Now people close to the President have expressed concern that he is buying into Giuliani's false claims that his legal efforts can change the election's outcome. He has shown no signs of backing down, even as those around him continue indicating that the end is near. Those allies have expressed worry that a sizable faction of the country thinks the election was stolen from Trump and that Biden isn't receiving national security briefings.  Giuliani did not respond to multiple attempts by CNN to reach him on Monday.""If he had any character, I would say it's perfectly in character. It displeases him when reality doesn't conform to the image that he has of it,"" said John Bolton, the President's former national security adviser, on ABC. ""I do not expect him to go graciously. I do expect him to go. But I think pretty soon we'll get the stab in the back theories. We'll get the dark conspiracy theories continued. And he will make life as difficult as he can for the incoming Biden administration."" Bolton departed the White House on bad terms with Trump. But even his successor on Monday seemed to acknowledge the likelihood that Trump would no longer be President come January 20. ""If there is a new administration, they deserve some time to come in and implement their policies,"" national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in a discussion at the Soufan Center's Global Security Forum that aired on Monday. ""If the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner -- and obviously things look that way now -- we'll have a very professional transition from the National Security Council."" Trump has pinned his strategy around thin legal long shots in Michigan and Pennsylvania, but his campaign is already taking its last gasps in court in those cases, having failed repeatedly and seen its legal avenues shut off. In many of the places where Trump is contesting results, there aren't enough contestable votes to make a dent in the results as states near the deadlines for certification.  At least two small counties in Georgia finished their presidential recounts without finding any discrepancies. The audit process is expected to finish in the coming days, and Georgia's secretary of state says he plans to certify the official results by Friday, as required by state law. A recount in Wisconsin, which the Trump campaign has said it will request, would cost them nearly $8 million, the state said on Monday, since the party requesting the recount must pay for it. The Trump campaign is still mounting some appeals, but those are also unlikely to succeed, especially as the battleground states' deadlines to certify their election results approach in the coming weeks. The Electoral College is set to meet in mid-December, formalizing Biden's win. A hearing is scheduled in a federal court in Pennsylvania on Tuesday about whether the Trump campaign's case there should be dismissed. That case initially was the boldest attempt by Trump to throw out or block the certification of votes in Pennsylvania, but Trump campaign lawyers cut back the case substantially over the weekend, after an appeals court shut down their ability to try to claim some election administration unfair under the Constitution. The case now focuses on the alleged unfairness of how counties in Pennsylvania handled absentee voting. That has left Trump to try to push a baseless claim about election software produced by the firm Dominion, a conspiracy theory US government officials and Dominion have directly refuted but which Trump remains fixated upon, according to people familiar with the matter.Several court cases from Trump allies that alleged voter fraud have also fallen apart, with four cases from voters in Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania dropped on Monday. The lawsuits had promised ""expert reports"" that might reveal fraud related to absentee ballots, but James Bopp Jr., a well-known conservative lawyer working on the suits on behalf of the voters, told CNN his team couldn't make the reports because they didn't have access to confidential lists of voters.Nursing old grievances Legal efforts aside, the President's refusal to concede stems in part from his perceived grievance that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama undermined his own presidency by saying Russia interfered in the 2016 election and could have impacted the outcome, people around him say.Trump continues to hold a grudge against those he claims undercut his election by pointing to Russian interference efforts, and has suggested it is fair game to not recognize Biden as the President-elect, even though Clinton conceded on election night in 2016 and the Trump transition was able to begin immediately.  Trump is also continuing to process the emotional scars of losing to a candidate he repeatedly said during the campaign was an unworthy opponent whose win would amount to humiliation. ""The most important thing we need to keep in mind is that Donald is in a unique position for him,"" said Mary Trump, the President's niece who wrote a damning account of his family life. ""He's never in his life been in a situation that he can't get out of either through using somebody else's money, using connections, using power. And not only is he in a unique position, he's in a position of being a loser, which in my family, certainly, as far as my grandfather was concerned, was the worst possible thing you could be.""CNN's Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.",2020-11-17T01:16:15Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/politics/trump-election-challenge-biden-legitimacy/index.html,2020-11-17 10:36:06.871788,CNN,politics,0
" Emily Murphy, do your job (opinion)","""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil,"" goes the quote typically attributed to Edmund Burke, ""is for good men to do nothing.""  Jill FilipovicAn implied addition: For evil to survive, some people also have to choose to do wrong.  This week, both the administrator of the General Services Administration, Emily Murphy, and Donald Trump's personal lawyer (and the former New York City mayor) Rudy Giuliani have made themselves two exemplars of that Burkean aphorism.Read More Murphy is refusing to do her job: doing nothing, technically, but making a clear choice to do harm by blocking a key part of the transition to the incoming government of Joe Biden. Giuliani is making an affirmative choice to undermine confidence in American democracy and our system of free and fair elections. This is how great institutions crumble: Not just by inertia and excuse-making for the decay, but because a small handful of people decide that doing maximum damage — whether actively or through inaction — is justifiable if it is to their immediate benefit. Let's start with Murphy, a previously little-known Trump appointee to the obscure office of Administrator of the General Services Administration.   The President has refused to concede the presidential race to the winner, Biden. So Murphy has essentially put the bulldozer in neutral, taken her foot off the brake, and claims there's nothing she can do as it rolls downhill. Her chief duty right now is to affirm the projected result of the presidential contest  — as GSA administrators before her have generally done within a matter of hours of the election being called — so that the incoming administration's personnel can get busy setting up a new government. She has declined to do this. And so, like her boss, has made the whole country vulnerable. The process Murphy is in charge of, called ""ascertainment,"" is necessary for the seamless transition of power. Among other things, her signature on an ascertainment letter formalizes the transition, providing money, access to officials, agencies, equipment, and office space. It allows the incoming president to be briefed on national security.   JUST WATCHEDLankford says he did 'step in' over Biden intelligence briefingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLankford says he did 'step in' over Biden intelligence briefing 01:23Some 4,000 political appointments need to be made, and given that many are in health and national security, they can't wait. In a scaling-up pandemic that has killed a quarter-million Americans, this transition is more important than ever. Biden will take office with massive crises on his hands, and he needs to start attacking them as soon as he can.  Murphy is a partisan appointee, installed in her current position by Trump. She stands out among other routine appointees for enmeshing this relatively straightforward job in political controversy, and for deferring to the President as if he's a dictator and not an elected leader serving at the will of the people. ""I am not here to garner headlines or make a name for myself,"" Murphy said back in 2017, during her Senate confirmation hearing. ""My goal is to do my part in making the federal government more efficient, effective and responsive to the American people."" Either she was lying then or has fully surrendered her old goals. She has made an ignominious name for herself, though she has yet to speak publicly about her failure to acknowledge Biden's win. And she has single-handedly created chaos, inefficiency, and ineffectiveness, all while steadfastly refusing to respond to the American people, who, after all, have spoken through the ballot box. Murphy may be the newest pro-Trump loyalist to use her position for ill, but she's hardly alone. Rudy Giuliani is using (and abusing) the legal system to do his damage. On Tuesday, he asked to join the lawsuit challenging the Pennsylvania vote count and requesting that the state not certify the election results. Lindsey Graham fuels Republican civil war in Georgia  The challenge is largely baseless, and Giuliani's entrance is a kind of Trump Team Hail Mary, which is why two teams of more reputable attorneys already quit the case. But Giuliani is doing his part to extend the President's delusions of victory, and to tell American voters —baselessly — that our system is rigged, that Democrats stole the election, and that the American system is not to be trusted. A great many conservative voters seem to be buying this dangerous lie. But it's the rest of us who will pay the price Murphy and Giuliani are extracting: a slowed-down government less equipped to handle a deadly and devastating crisis; a divided and polarized nation where Trump followers increasingly live in their own ideological, fact-compromised universe, Trump opponents wonder whether we can coexist with people so divorced from reality — and everyone is angry and resentful.

But they are doing tremendous damage along the way. Biden will be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. And when he's in office, we shouldn't forget just the ""good"" people who did nothing to push back against Trump, but those who chose to commit bad, dangerous, self-interested acts. They should find no rehabilitation and no absolution from Washington. To put it in more Trumpian terms: They should never work in this town again.

 iPhone 12 mini vs iphone 12 Pro Max: What's right for you?,"Anyone thinking about upgrading their iPhone now has two more options to consider: smaller or super big.The iPhone 12 mini (starting at $699) and the iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1099) go on sale Friday. They join a lineup that includes the iPhone 12 ($799) and iPhone 12 Pro ($999), both of which went on sale last month. (Read our review of the 12 and Pro here.) I spent several days trying out the new phones to find out just how much you lose by scaling down to a mini and how much you gain by taking your phone choice to the max.The iPhone mini (left) vs. the giant iPhone Pro Max. Small but powerfulTesting out Apple's newest and tiniest phone felt like a throwback to phones from over five years ago, when the basic phone was still modestly sized compared to the giants of today. But it wasn't a step backward by any means: The mini packs all the new features of the iPhone 12 -- such as a stellar camera, a faster chip, OLED display, and 5G capability. But there are a few important differences, namely the size, price and battery life.Read MoreWith its 5.4-inch screen, the mini looks like a slightly shrunken version of the iPhone 12, which has a 6.1-inch screen. You can comfortably hold the mini in your hand, easily fit it in your pocket or a car cup holder, and when you're talking on the phone it doesn't feel like you're holding up a brick.  But while the mini succeeds in delivering impressive features on important things like the camera, I'm accustomed to bigger phones after years of using them, and it's hard to go back. After some time with the mini, you start to realize the limitations of small phones and why manufacturers have largely moved on. There's a learning curve to typing on a small phone again. My fingers kept bumping into each other because the keyboard is so much smaller than what I'm used to. (I guess I could go back to texting with one hand?) Consuming media on the mini isn't the best experience, and it feels cramped if you have to tap messages and emails out all day. Some people will love the small size; some people will definitely wish they had gone larger.Like the iPhone 12, the mini has two cameras and a new sleek design with flat edges. Both models come in red, green, blue, black and white. Just like the 12, the mini takes excellent photos, especially at night. An improved version of Night mode, first introduced with last year's iPhone 11, brightens low-light selfies or photos taken at nighttime, resulting in better contrast and more details, without needing a flash. It definitely wowed me, and put photos taken at night by my iPhone XR (which doesn't have Night mode) to shame. Pumpkins captured by the iPhone XR (left), iPhone 12 Mini (middle) and iPhone Pro Max (right) at night time. The iPhone Pro Max is very big. Like huge. On the other end of the spectrum -- both in terms of price and size -- is the iPhone 12 Pro Max.It's the highest-end option with the biggest starting price tag and largest screen. The 6.7-inch screen is the biggest screen ever on an iPhone, and blows past the iPhone 12 and Pro's 6.1-inch displays. Some people may love it, while others may find excessive. One thing is for certain: Watching a video on its massive screen is superior to any other iPhone I've tested. You'll also see more content and text on screen. But the tradeoff is that you have to lug around a ginormous phone. iPhone 12 review: Upgrade for the camera, not 5GThe Pro and Pro Max both have three cameras (compared to the iPhone 12, they have an additional telephoto lens). Their cameras are aided by lidar, a technology most commonly associated with self-driving cars, which helps the camera focus faster in low-light settings. The most obvious difference between the two is that the Pro Max has a telephoto camera capable of tighter closeup shots. That means you'll get a 2.5x zoom on the Pro Max, compared to the Pro's 2x zoom and a 1x zoom on the iPhone 12 and mini. When testing, I took photos of the same subject or object with both the Pro and Pro Max during different times of day. Both phones took excellent shots that were bright, detailed and showed contrast without needing any editing. The Pro Max's 2.5x zoom makes it easier to zero in on something farther away, without moving closer or losing image quality, although the Pro's 2x zoom still mostly did the trick. For very serious photographers, the Pro Max adds a few extra features, such as sensor-shift optical image stabilization and a larger image sensor on the main camera, that may improve image quality in certain situations. But unless you are a pro, you won't notice a huge difference. These photos taken from the same vantage point, show the Pro Max (right) has a tighter 2.5x zoom. Like the Pro, the Pro Max comes in silver, black, gold and blue with fancy stainless steel edges that scream glam. Given how niche the Max's advantages are and how large and expensive it is, it's safe to say that if you don't know you want the Max, you probably don't want it. Battery life: Go big or charge frequentlyIn my experience, the mini's battery lasted from when I got up until the early evening with regular use. I texted, checked social media, read emails and watched a 20-minute episode on Netflix. Just before 5 pm, I was already down to 25% battery, and it had dropped below 10% by 7 pm. My phone was toast around 8:30 pm. The Pro Max and other phones in the iPhone 12 lineup would last until I went to bed, and even had some juice left, with the Pro Max lasting the longest. CNN Underscored: The iPhone 12 Mini is what all small phones should be5G — although not fully accessible yet -- will be a further battery drain. Depending on your carrier and where you live, you will see different 5G download and upload speeds, so it's not something to be worried about just yet. Plus, Apple's smart data mode will automatically switch the iPhone to LTE to save battery life when 5G isn't delivering noticeably better speeds. The entire iPhone 12 line, including the mini and Pro Max, also use Apple's new Ceramic Shield glass, which the company claims is scratch resistant and fares much better when dropped. It's unclear how much more durable these phones will be over time, but the mini and Pro Max (with cases on) both accidentally slid out of my sweatshirt pocket onto the sidewalk when I was walking my dog. The Pro Max was fine, while the mini suffered a small ding at the bottom of the phone. After testing the mini for a few days, I also noticed a small scratch near the top of the screen. Last month, I dropped the iPhone Pro on a stone walkway and then later on a hardwood floor (I'm a bit clumsy) and it didn't result in any damage. These isolated incidents are obviously inconclusive, but at least for one phone, the Ceramic Shield wasn't invincible. Should I upgrade?This year, Apple is offering more phone choices than ever. Those with last year's iPhone 11 can likely skip the upgrade this year, but for those holding on to older models such as the iPhone X, iPhone XR, or iPhone 8, it could be time for a refresh. The Pro and Pro Max will give users a fancier finish and additional camera tricks, but for most people the iPhone 12 (or the 12 mini) will be impressive enough. For the mini, you have to decide whether you prefer a smaller-sized phone and are willing to sacrifice battery life and display size to save on the price tag.

Obama says election results show nation is deeply divided,"Former President Barack Obama said the election results, in which each candidate received more than 70 million votes, show the nation remains bitterly split.""What it says is that we are still deeply divided. The power of that alternative worldview that's presented in the media that those voters consume -- it carries a lot of weight,"" Obama told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview that aired on ""CBS Sunday Morning."" Asked by King if that worries him, the former President responded, ""Yes. It's very hard for our democracy to function if we are operating on just completely different sets of facts.""Obama memoir confronts role his presidency played in Republican obstructionism and Trump's riseObama has done a series of interviews timed to the release of the first volume of his memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" which will be available November 17. The book chronicles the 44th President's childhood and political rise, before diving into his historic 2008 campaign and first four years in the White House. Obama, the country's first Black president, also confronts the racist politics of President Donald Trump, suggesting his 2008 election opened a wave of bitter and divisive turmoil that fueled Republicans' obstructionism and ultimately changed the party.Obama on Sunday defended his active campaigning for President-elect Joe Biden, his former vice president, saying circumstances warranted his public criticism of his successor -- something that former presidents usually don't do. Read More""It is not my preference to be out there,"" he told King. ""I think we were in a circumstance in this election in which certain norms, certain institutional values that are so extraordinarily important, had been breached. That it was important for me, as somebody who had served in that office, to simply let people know, 'This is not normal.'""Trump has refused to concede, repeatedly claiming without evidence that the election was rigged and continuing to push unsupported legal challenges of the results. The formal transition between the Trump administration and the incoming Biden-Harris administration is likely to remain on hold until the election is certified by a Trump appointee within the General Services Administration in a process known as ascertainment.Analysis: Biden has a better shot at riding the economy up now than Obama didDuring a separate interview with CBS' Scott Pelley that aired Sunday evening on ""60 Minutes,"" Obama slammed Republican officials for backing the President's false claims of election fraud and said the allegations endangered democracy. ""We would never accept that out of our own kids behaving that way if they lost, right? I mean, if my daughters -- in any kind of competition -- pouted and -- and then accused the other side of cheating when they lost, when there was no evidence of it, we'd scold 'em,"" Obama said. Presidents, he maintained, are ""temporary occupants of the office, by design.""""And when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments,"" Obama said. ""My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first it's time for you to do the same thing.""And speaking on the importance of a peaceful transition with King, Obama similarly said that ""it's a temporary job. We're not above the rules. We're not above the law. That's the essence of our democracy.""Asked what advice he would give Biden, Obama said he believes the President-elect doesn't need his advice but pledged to help him in ""any ways that I can.""""I'm not planning to suddenly work on the White House staff or something ... Michelle would leave me,"" he joked of the former first lady. ""She'd be like what? You're doing what?""Although, Trump has frequently attacked Obama, the former President said he does not take them seriously.""There are many things he says that I do not take personally or seriously, although I think they can often be destructive and harmful,"" Obama told King.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the title of former President Barack Obama's memoir.CNN's Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",2020-11-15T17:29:40Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/politics/barack-obama-donald-trump-concede-divided-nation/index.html,2020-11-16 11:40:44.341613,CNN,politics,0
New Zealand suffers shock loss to Argentina in Rugby Championship ,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest sports teams in the world, New Zealand's rugby union team suffered a shock 25-15 loss on Saturday as Argentina beat the All Blacks for the first time in its history.  New Zealand, a three-time world champion, has now suffered two successive defeats for the first time since August 2011. The All Blacks lost 24-22 to Australia last weekend in Brisbane. Defender scores 'miraculous' goal""This is a big day for Argentina rugby and also for our country and people,"" Argentina captain Pablo Matera told reporters after the Rugby Championship match in Sydney. Remarkably, it was the Pumas' first Test in over a year -- since the 2019 Rugby World Cup -- and a first win over New Zealand at the 30th time of asking, ending a 35-year wait. Nicolas Sanchez scored all of Argentina's points with a try, six penalties and a conversion to record one of the biggest upsets in rugby union history. Read MoreNew Zealand captain Sam Cane's try reduced the deficit to nine points midway through th second half, but Argentina held firm. Caleb Clarke crossed over the line late on, but it was mere consolation for a New Zealand team which remains top of the Rugby Championship table.

Kakapo wins New Zealand Bird of the Year after a campaign tainted by voter fraud,"A lengthy and bitter election campaign that dragged in competing interest groups and was sullied by a voter fraud scandal came to an unlikely end on Monday, when a fat, flightless and nocturnal parrot stunned pundits to claim an upset victory.The kakapo, officially the world's heaviest parrot, won New Zealand's Bird of the Year vote after a weeks-long campaign that rivaled human political contests in intensity.It became the first bird to win the contest for a second time -- a feat not explicitly prohibited by the country's constitution -- and snatched victory thanks to the competition's unique and convoluted voting system, having lost the outright popular vote to the Antipodean albatross.""In a stunning upset the kākāpō swoops in from behind to claw the title of #BirdOfTheYear 2020 away from competition front-runner,"" Forest & Bird, the environmental group that organizes the annual contest, announced on social media on Monday.The New Zealand competition frequently turns heated, as politicians, celebrities and online groups endorse their preferred creatures.Read MoreThe little spotted kiwi was another contender for the prize.But this year's event became particularly controversial after organizers detected that more than 1,500 fraudulent votes, cast using fake email addresses traced back to the same IP address, briefly pushed the little spotted kiwi to the top of the leaderboard.Amid a flurry of endorsements for various contenders, sex toy retailer Adult Toy Megastore backed the hihi, which it said practices ""consensual polyamory.""And campaigners for the different contenders sought to canvass votes across various media, with supporters of the takahe -- a large, flightless rail -- creating a TikTok account to boost youth turnout.Ultimately, however, the defeated favorites graciously conceded defeat to the kakapo, which previously won the award in 2008.""It's been a tight race throughout the election period, but @team_kakapo Kākāpō snatched victory from the beak of defeat and overtaken us in the instant-runoff voting at the end,"" the ""Albatross for Bird of the Year"" campaign wrote on Twitter.A history of vote-fixingOrganizers said more than 55,000 people voted in the competition, which is ostensibly used to highlight the plight of New Zealand's endangered bird species but frequently leads to partially tongue-in-cheek tussles between campaigns and attempts at vote-rigging.In 2018, hundreds of dubious votes were detected for the shag, and the previous year more than 100 fraudulent votes were logged for the white-faced heron.The kakapo, which prevailed on Monday, is a hefty, loud parrot with a distinctive scent, which was brought from the brink of extinction in the 1990s but remains endangered.New Zealand discovers 1,500 fraudulent votes ... in an election on birds""It's like its feathers have been dipped in a musky array of essential oils that could come straight from a Middle Eastern perfumier,"" the competition's website wrote.The contest also showcased a number of other unusual candidates, including the morepork or ruru -- described by Forest & Bird as ""somewhat of an enigma"" -- and piwauwau or rock wren, which demonstrates ""true mountain bravery.""""Unfortunately, many of New Zealand's native birds are in trouble and need your help,"" Forest & Bird wrote when announcing the winner. ""Their habitats are being destroyed or degraded by introduced predators, pollution, human development, and climate change.""The competition came weeks after New Zealand's general election, which was won more comfortably by incumbent Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern -- and also came days after Joe Biden won the US Presidential race.",2020-11-16T11:20:31Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/asia/kakapo-new-zealand-bird-vote-scli-intl-scn/index.html,2020-11-17 10:33:18.441710,CNN,politics,0
'Trial 4' review: Another story of police misconduct and systemic injustice,"Ever since Netflix helped launch the modern true-crime docuseries craze with ""Making a Murderer"" five years ago, networks and services have been seeking stories with similar heft. ""Trial 4"" fits that bill -- dealing with police misconduct, systemic racism and a miscarriage of justice -- without quite reaching those levels, mostly due to stretching the project over a few-too-many parts.The central story -- the multiple trials, and eventual conviction, of Sean Ellis for the 1993 murder of Boston police detective John Mulligan -- certainly resonates. Investigators fixed on Ellis, then just 19, despite shaky evidence, resulting in two mistrials before his conviction and life sentence. Ellis served more than 20 years until a new attorney, Rosemary Scapicchio, took up his case, revealing corruption within the department.""The way that the police said it happened didn't make any sense,"" Scapicchio, who emerges as a genuine hero, says in describing her initial reaction, running headlong into the reluctance of law enforcement and prosecutors to admit mistakes while protecting their own.Using animation to reenact the actual crime -- and various accounts and theories of what might have transpired -- director Rémy Burkel methodically breaks down the narrative, jumping back and forth in time as the blunt-talking Scapicchio and more reserved Ellis prepare for a fourth trial (hence the title), having won that right in 2015.The dense back story includes salacious details about the victim, which potentially explain why others might have harbored motives to kill him; questions about a key witness, Rosa Sanchez, amid reports that corrupt cops pressured witnesses and even fabricated informants; and eventually a campaign for district attorney that ushers in reformer Rachael Rollins, offering the prospect of progress after cops had been allowed to bend and break rules with few repercussions from that office.Read More""Trial 4"" exposes how Boston police historically sought Black suspects to charge in unsolved crimes. As Boston Globe columnist Adrian Walker puts it, ""The cops were just looking for someone to pin this murder on.""With policing under the microscope, ""Trial 4"" possesses a greater sense of timeliness and considerable weight. Eight hours, however, is a lot of time to keep rehashing the specifics of Ellis' story -- an increasingly common excess in the docuseries genre -- as tragic, upsetting and ultimately inspiring as that might be. While ""Making a Murderer"" provided something of a template, that was distinguished in part by its trove of interrogation video, and frankly, its novelty at the time. There's been a whole lot of true crime, sadly chronicling other travesties, in the years since.That hardly undercuts what the filmmakers (a team that includes Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, who also produced ""The Staircase"") accomplish in terms of ""Trial 4's"" relevance and urgency. The main and by-now familiar drawback is that the series' pacing doesn't exhibit a bit more of the latter.""Trial 4"" premieres Nov. 11 on Netflix.",2020-11-11T21:40:20Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/entertainment/trial-4-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:16:43.617075,CNN,technology,0
Boris Johnson is trapped at home at the worst possible time,"For the second time this year, the coronavirus has found its way to the very top of British politics and forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson into self-quarantine. On Sunday night, Johnson tweeted that he must ""self-isolate for two weeks, after being in contact with someone with Covid-19."" ""It doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies,"" he said in a Monday video message, adding that he ""felt great"" and would keep leading the UK virus response, as well as his government's plans to ""#BuildBackBetter.""Yet the optimism in that message, including the hashtag, masks the reality of exactly how enormous a week this is for the Johnson premiership, and how much of a blow it is for the PM to be trapped in solitude. Downing Street had spent the weekend dealing with the fallout from three straight days of chaos, in which two of his most senior advisers dramatically resigned following allegations that they had been briefing viciously against both Johnson himself and his fiancée, Carrie Symonds.  Johnson has mismanaged Covid, Brexit and the economy. Now his inner circle is falling outRead MoreThe advisers in question, Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings, were among the most controversial and disliked members of Johnson's inner circle and have been accused by numerous people in government of being power hungry and self-interested. Before Johnson's self-quarantining, the turmoil in Downing Street had dominated five days of coverage in the UK, overshadowing what is arguably an even bigger headache for the PM than the coronavirus. Brexit really is now on the home stretch. The current transition period -- which was designed to prevent a sudden halt of the flow of goods, among other things, between the UK and the European Union -- ends on December 31. If the two sides are unable to strike a free trade agreement before that date, then the chaotic no-deal cliff edge -- which many fear would lead to shortages in things like food, toilet paper and medicine -- would be the new reality. Thursday's video conference of the EU27 is the penultimate time that the heads of government from the bloc's member states are scheduled to meet before the end of the year. The final meeting of 2020, on December 10, is considered too late in the day. As has been the case for months, a deal is in sight and the areas of agreement vastly outweigh the areas of disagreement. However, the key stumbling blocks that have prevented a deal remain. The first and most important is Brussels' insistence on a level playing field in exchange for access to the EU's single market. This, for some time, has been a red line for the UK, which objects to being bound by EU competition rules prohibiting how the government could use state aid to help the growth of British enterprise. Boris Johnson accused of 'giving in to scientific advisers' as England heads for lockdownThe two other key sticking points -- fishing rights and the involvement of EU law in the arbitration of any deal -- are also difficult, though it's easier to see a path to agreement in both.It has for some time been assumed that when the talks reached the stages that they are at now (with legal texts on the table and a deal within grasp), the negotiators, who are civil servants acting on the mandate of their political leadership, would make way for political leaders to bridge the final gaps. With Johnson in self-quarantine, any hope of a last-minute dash reminiscent of his meeting with then-Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to reach the first Brexit deal is out the window.  Of course, Johnson is able to pick up the phone and speak to anyone he likes. Members of both the UK and EU's negotiation teams have previously told CNN, however, that virtual meetings during the first European lockdown seriously damaged progress in talks and that informal, one-to-one chats had helped considerably in previous rounds of negations. If no deal is agreed before Thursday, things really do get hairy. ""It's possible talks could go on next week, the EU has a near-limitless capacity for flexibility on time,"" says Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King's College London. ""However, the question is how much flexibility is there politically, given the time left. If the current deal is intolerable to the UK, then there's no real time to negotiate anything substantively different."" Of course, there are more issues than Brexit competing for the precious little time that Johnson has, now that he's locked up for two weeks. There's the small matter of the UK's response to the pandemic, which has been criticized from nearly every possible perspective. Biden saw echoes of Trump in Boris Johnson. Will it complicate the US-UK 'special relationship'?There was also hope that after the drama of last week, Johnson could reboot his premiership and tell his party faithful, many of whom despised Cummings and Cain, that his focus is firmly on his domestic, ""leveling-up"" agenda. He had hoped to meet Conservative MPs in person to further reassure them. Last week's bombshells provided hope for many who felt that Cummings had too much influence on Johnson's thinking. From the pandemic response, which Johnson's lawmakers felt was a little trigger happy on lockdowns, to the numerous Brexit red lines, many in the governing Conservative Party felt that Cummings had too much power over Johnson. It's plausible that Cummings' departure could see a softening on certain issues and the securing of a deal with the EU. It is possible that Johnson can finally shake off the idea that it was Cummings who was leading most government policy, including the pandemic response. However, the reality is that Johnson is now locked behind closed doors with the Brexit clock ticking, an overflowing domestic inbox and little wiggle room to handle either of the crises that could await him in December: a Christmas canceled by the coronavirus and a no-deal Brexit for New Year.

We understand that this blanket kind of lockdown, which did the trick then, may not be the best way now,"" he said. ""It's not about whether a store is open or not. It's about your and my behavior. It's about whether we think, 'Oh, I know that person, so I'm familiar with them. I can hang out with them ... Those things are what's causing the spread.""So if people don't like shutdowns, the solutions are simple: ""Cancel those vacation plans right now. Do not sneak in other households for Thanksgiving,"" Garcetti said. ""To me, the mantra is two things: Don't share your air, and don't do stupid things."" More states are setting new rulesWith the rapid acceleration of new infections, many states are scrambling to curb the virus with new restrictions. Among them: -- Washington state announced new restrictions on social gatherings, businesses and religious services.Washington state enacts new restrictions, months after it was first in the US to confront Covid-19-- Michigan announced high schools and colleges will shift to remote learning for three weeks, among other restrictions on social gatherings and businesses.-- Utah now has a statewide mask mandate. -- Ohio is enacting stricter mask mandates for businesses-- New Mexico is banning in-person services for nonessential businesses.-- Maryland is scaling back indoor restaurant dining capacity from 75% to 50%. -- New York says most bars and restaurants must close by 10 p.m. -- Oregon is closing indoor restaurant dining and limiting social gatherings to no more than six people. The Navajo Nation will also implement stricter measures starting Monday, including virtual learning for students and the closure of non-essential government services.""We are in the worst moment of this pandemic to date. The situation has never been more dire,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday in announcing new restrictions, pointing to the approaching winter months when people will gather indoors, raising the risk of spreading the coronavirus. ""We are at the precipice and we need to take some action."" ""We are inching closer and closer to a major public health crisis in which we could potentially see our hospitals filling up with patients,"" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said. ""Our health care system on the Navajo Nation cannot sustain a long-term surge in COVID-19 cases."" Hospitals are at the worst point ever in this pandemicRemember those grim scenes from the spring and summer surge, when hospitals were overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients? The US set a new record-high number of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 on Saturday -- 69,455, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Some hospitals are running out of health care workers. Here's what could happen nextThat's well beyond the spring peak of 59,940, on April 15, and the summer peak of 59,718 on July 23.In some hospitals, the staffing is so dire that asymptomatic doctors and nurses infected with coronavirus are allowed to keep working in Covid-19 units. Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University, told CNN that health care workers are watching their colleagues get sick, and they're ""worn out and tired and scared."" ""We are looking at patients who can't see their families to say goodbye,"" she said. ""It's just the beeping of a machine, the sound of a ventilator."" She said the strain on hospitals impacts not just Covid-19 patients, but those dealing with other issues like cancer, heart attacks and strokes. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said that wearing masks or social distancing would not last ""in perpetuity.""""Now's not the time to be defiant of masks,"" he said. ""Now's not the time to be defiant about social distancing."" Fauci: Local shutdowns are more likely than a national lockdownIf hospitals get overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, local or state officials might order some places to shut down again, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci: A smooth transfer between presidents is important for public health, ""like passing the baton in a race"" ""We're not going to get a national lockdown,"" Fauci said. ""But I think what we are going to start seeing in the local levels, be they governors or mayors or people at the local level, will do ... very surgical type of restrictions which are the functional equivalent of a local lockdown.""""If things really get bad,"" Fauci said, ""you may need to take the extra step you're talking about."" Two former commissioners of the Food and Drug Administration say it's up to governors to slow the virus's spread.""The latest US Covid surge isn't confined to certain regions like the ones in the spring and summer. It's hitting the whole nation hard,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Mark McClellan wrote in an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal. ""In previous waves, health-care workers from less-affected areas were deployed to New York and the South. It isn't possible to send an army of health-care personnel into hot zones when the entire country is a hot zone.""They said the Covid response had been a joint effort between the federal government and states. ""But the White House is changing hands during the most critical point of the pandemic, and it's a particularly important time for leadership from governors, mayors and county administrators,"" they wrote.""Governors and local leaders should first reinforce steps known to be effective: wearing a quality mask, avoiding gatherings and maintaining social distance, especially indoors. Halloween gatherings contributed to the current spread, and Thanksgiving will be no different without more vigilance,"" Gottlieb and McClellan warned. The flu season collides with the pandemicHospitals aren't just grappling with coronavirus. They're also dealing with the flu, which caused an estimated 400,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths in the US during the last flu season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yes, you can have Covid-19 and the flu at the same time. Here's what that could do to your bodyBoth flu and coronavirus can cause many of the same symptoms, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said.But ""the one symptom that I would alert people to that really differentiates flu from Covid is loss of taste or smell,"" Adams said on NPR's ""All Things Considered."" ""If you get that symptom, then you need to be reaching out to your health provider right away and going in and getting a Covid test.""Adams encouraged the public to get a flu shot this year and warned not to self-diagnose. A health care provider can give better answers so patients can respond appropriately to their symptoms.""Covid seems to spread much more easily than the flu, and it causes much more serious illnesses in some people,"" he said.Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, said the symptoms between the flu and Covid-19 will be ""indistinguishable."" ""You should not go to work, you should not go to school, if you develop what feels like (the flu),"" because that could be Covid,"" he said.""You should quarantine and get a test.""

Dolly Parton helped fund Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine research,"In April, less than a month after Covid-19 was officially declared a pandemic, Dolly Parton donated $1 million to coronavirus research at Vanderbilt University. More than seven months later, it's been revealed that the legendary performer's donation helped fund Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, which this week became the second coronavirus vaccine with a stunningly high success rate.Moderna's coronavirus vaccine is 94.5% effective, according to company dataParton's name appears in the preliminary report on the vaccine among sponsors like the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Dr. Anthony Fauci heads, and Emory University. She originally donated to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in honor of her friend and Vanderbilt professor of surgery Dr. Naji Abumrad. The Moderna vaccine is 94.5% effective against coronavirus, according to early data released this week by the company. Vaccinations could begin as soon as late December, Fauci said, though they'll be made available first to high-risk groups like health care workers, the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions. Covid-19 has surged since Parton first made her donation. Then, there were just over 200,000 reported Covid-19 cases in the US. Now, there are over 11.2 million cases and nearly 250,000 Americans have died.  Read MoreDolly Parton donates $1 million toward coronavirus researchParton recognized then the severity of the virus and urged her fans to donate to Vanderbilt Health's Covid-19 research fund, which has raised more than $98,000 of its $250,000 goal. Her gift was first used toward research for interim Covid-19 treatments while the vaccine was being developed, she said in an April appearance on NBC's ""Today."" ""I felt like this was the time for me to open my heart and my hand and try to help,"" she said in her ""Today"" appearance.CNN has reached out to Moderna and representatives for Parton and is waiting to hear back.

Jeep unveils high-horsepower V8 Wrangler,"The new Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 has a 470-horsepower 6.4-liter V8 engine and can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in 4.5 seconds. That makes it the quickest and most powerful Wrangler the company has ever produced.This will be the first time in almost 40 years that the Wrangler or its predecessor, the Jeep CJ, has been offered with a V8 engine. The last V8-powered Jeep CJ, with 124-horsepower, was offered for the 1981 model year. At the time, Jeep was owned by American Motors Corporation, which was later acquired by Chrysler.Now the Jeep brand is owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), and executives there said the new V8 Wrangler was created in response to clear customer demand. ""Why are we doing it?"" said Scott Tallon, director of Jeep brand marketing for the US. ""Because our customers are doing it anyway."" The Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 is an inch higher than a standard Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and two inches higher than the base model.Some Wrangler owners have modified their Jeeps by fitting V8 engines into them. Many more have asked when Fiat Chysler would offer a V8 engine option, he said.Read MoreThe Wrangler's basic design had to be modified somewhat to fit the bigger engine. The Wrangler Rubicon 392 rides two inches higher off the ground than a base model Wrangler. Besides allowing more room for the engine, the higher ride height also allows for better off-road performance since the Wrangler can better clear obstacles and drive up steeper slopes. It can also wade through 2.7 feet of water.The Rubicon 392 has a bulging air scoop in the hood. The air scoop was engineered with a secondary path for air to get into the engine so that, even if the scoop's opening becomes clogged with mud or snow, the engine can still provide provide full power.Besides 470 horsepower, the V8 engine can also produce 470 pound feet of torque, a measure of raw pulling power irrespective of speed. It's all controlled through an eight-speed automatic transmission that can be shifted using paddles behind the steering wheel.Jeep gives us a glimpse of its new Grand WagoneerBecause it's still a Jeep Wrangler, Fiat Chrysler engineers were able to openly test drive prototypes of the Rubicon 392 on public trails alongside other off-road enthusiasts without attracting attention or questions.They also tested its acceleration on drag strips. They did not, however, test it on race tracks because, they said, taking curves at high speeds is just never a priority for any Wrangler, including this one.To save gas, the V8 engine has a cylinder deactivation system that shuts down four of the cylinders when not much power is needed. Fiat Chrysler has not released fuel economy estimates for the Rubicon 392, though. Pricing for the new Jeep will be announced closer to when it goes on sale in early 2021.The Rubicon 392 will give Jeep something its rival Ford does will not offer, at least for the time being, in its new Bronco. The Ford Bronco will go on sale next spring and it will be a direct competitor to the Wrangler. It will be offered with a choice of either a 270-horsepower four-cyinder or 310-horsepower six-cylinder engine.

The 2020 election just keeps getting worse for House Democrats,"As House Democrats prepare to reelect their entire leadership team this week, one thing has come into clear focus 14 days removed from the 2020 election: They got beat -- badly.While much of the focus in the days immediately after November 3 fell on whether Joe Biden had beaten Donald Trump (he had) and whether Democrats would win back the Senate majority (they haven't -- yet), the last few days have been filled with close House races (finally) being projected. And those projections reveal just how poorly House Democrats did.With just a handful of races still uncalled at this point, Republicans have gained nine seats -- having won 12 Democratic-held districts and lost just three of their own. And those numbers don't even tell the full story, given that two of the three seats Republicans lost were the direct result of a redrawing of North Carolina's congressional districts that reworked the map in ways that were decidedly unfavorable to the GOP. Subtract those two seats, which neither party spent any money in or seriously contested, and you are down to a single competitive seat that went from red to blue: The suburban Atlanta 7th District.As David Wasserman, the House editor at the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign tip sheet, noted on Twitter on Monday:""It's been almost two weeks since Election Day, and Democrats still haven't won a *single one* of the 27 House races in @CookPolitical's Toss Up column.""Read MoreThat's an incredible stat -- especially when you consider that the Democratic presidential nominee won 306 electoral votes (and a 4-million-plus popular vote margin) at the top of the ticket. And especially when you factor in the predictions of House Democratic leaders and independent handicappers that Democrats were poised to net double-digit seats and widen their majority.

To date, Democratic leaders have received something of a pass regarding just how badly they missed what was coming on November 3. While some vulnerable Democrats -- Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, most notably -- have made clear their dissatisfaction with the way the election played out, there hasn't been any sort of popular revolt against any member of the party leadership up to and including Speaker Nancy Pelosi.""We did not win every battle in the House, but we did win the war,"" Pelosi said in the aftermath of the election, making the point that no matter how the uncalled races fall, Democrats will still hold the House majority come January 2021.  And even as House Democrats have sustained even more losses as races have been called over the last 10 days, Pelosi has grown more strident in her defense of the results. ""I take credit for winning a majority and holding the House,"" she said recently.Which seems just fine with her Democratic colleagues! Pelosi, as well as House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Maryland) and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (South Carolina), are all expected to be reelected to their current leadership jobs this week by the full Democratic caucus.But reelected or not, there's simply no spinning what happened to House Democrats on November 3. It was a bad-bordering-on-disastrous election, particularly when you consider that their majority will be quite narrow heading into Biden's first midterm election, which, if history holds, is a bad one for the incumbent's party.",2020-11-17T17:40:57Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/2020-house-races-majority/index.html,2020-11-18 08:53:57.982991,CNN,politics,0
Dustin Johnson: Is golf set for a new era of dominance after Masters win?,"Remaining calm on golf's biggest stages has been one of Dustin Johnson's greatest strengths. However, after winning his first Masters and slipping on that distinctive Green Jacket, it all proved to be too much for the 36-year-old as he fought back tears in his post-victory interview. Four years on from his first major victory, Johnson is having a 2020 to remember. A maiden win at Augusta, his first Tour Championship title, two further PGA Tour victories and a return to the world No. 1 spot. Tiger Woods cards a 10 on notorious par-three hole at Masters And after claiming that elusive second major victory in such an emphatic manner, posting a record score of 20 under par to win by five strokes, Johnson isn't planning to ""dial anything back.""""I want to get to number three first, but I do dream of winning a lot of majors,"" Johnson said in his press conference afterwards.Read More""Just hadn't quite happened yet.

It means so much to my family, Paulina, the kids. They know it's something that I've always been dreaming about and it's why I work so hard.""Johnson celebrates with Gretzky during the Green Jacket ceremony.A local boyGrowing up in South Carolina, winning at the Masters has long been a dream for Johnson. ""Just growing up so close to here, it's always been a tournament that since I've been on Tour, since I played my first Masters, it's been the tournament I wanted to win the most,"" Johnson explained. ""Being close the last couple years, finishing second last year to Tiger, this one was just something that I really wanted to do.""When he was discovering his love for the game as a child, pretending that he was putting to win the Masters was a common occurrence. ""Always around the putting green growing up, it was putts to win the Masters or hitting chip shots,"" he said. ""It was always to win Augusta. Especially because I grew up so close to here, about an hour, hour and 10 minutes away.""And to have five-time Masters winner Woods help him into his Green Jacket made it just that bit sweeter.

Home delivery is the final frontierStory by Hanna Ziady, CNN BusinessVideo by Joseph Ataman and Sofia Couceiro, CNN BusinessGraphics by Tal Yellin, CNN BusinessUpdated 0915 GMT (1715 HKT) November 14, 2020Thomas Wall had a problem. It was the summer of 1913 and business was flagging at T. Wall & Sons, his family butcher shop in London.Overheated shoppers just weren't buying the company's specialty sausages. Then, Wall had an epiphany: Selling ice cream could help counteract the seasonal sales slump.The idea was set aside when World War I started a year later. But the arrival of a commercial freezer from the United States in 1922 catalyzed his ambitions. From a factory in west London, Wall's ice cream was soon being hawked to Londoners via horse and cart, and then by salespeople on tricycles. By 1939, there were 8,500 of the company's tricycles on Britain's roads.Wall's ice cream salesmen in Britain in 1922 (left) and 1938 (right).Meanwhile, a consumer goods juggernaut was being created. Wall's was bought by Lever Brothers, then selling Sunlight soap, which merged with Dutch company Margarine Unie in 1930 to create Unilever (UL). The Anglo-Dutch firm has gone on to acquire some two dozen other major ice cream brands, including Klondike and Ben & Jerry's, while pioneering its own Magnum line. It sells ice cream in 63 countries around the world and commands almost a fifth of global ice cream sales, a bigger share than its next four competitors combined, according to market research firm Euromonitor.Read MoreUnilever is now the undisputed king of ice cream. But as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, and lockdowns persist, the company is taking inspiration from the delivery tricycles of its early years to conquer one final frontier: ice cream delivered to your home, on demand.Ice cream around every cornerIt won't have far to travel. Chances are, while reading this article you're no more than a few hundred yards away from a Unilever ice cream.The company owns five of the world's 10 most valuable ice cream brands, including Breyers, Cornetto, Carte d'Or and Ben & Jerry's. But its empire extends far beyond these familiar names. There's Frigo in Spain, Adityaa in India, Holanda in Mexico, Langnese in Germany, Selecta in the Philippines, Ola in South Africa and Pingüino in Ecuador. In recent years, Unilever has also built out its premium offering to fend off a growing number of innovative rivals, snapping up gelato and sorbet brands such as America's Talenti, Italy's Grom and Australia's Weis.Many of these may be unfamiliar, but you've probably come across the brand that more than any other heralded Unilever's ice cream ambitions: Magnum. The world's best-selling ice cream brand, Magnum's sales to consumers are expected to reach $3.8 billion this year, ahead of sister brand Cornetto ($2.4 billion) and General Mills' (GIS) Häagen-Dazs ($3.2 billion), said Euromonitor.  Unilever ""got serious"" about ice cream when it launched Magnum in 1989, said Matt Close, the company's executive vice president for global ice cream. Vanilla ice cream bars on sticks, dipped in chocolate that cracks on the first bite and then dissolves in your mouth, were a decadent new taste sensation.""That really revolutionized the ice cream industry, but also our ice cream business,"" Close told CNN Business. ""Suddenly we moved from being a kind of kids seaside treat to something that people were eating in many more locations.""The realization that ice cream could be a treat for grownups changed the business. It ushered in a wave of ever more indulgent, upmarket brands, which have in turn given way to healthier, plant-based alternatives as consumer preferences evolve.

Unilever's approach has been to go after the whole market, rather than target any particular segment. Its 35 ice cream brands come at every price point, for all occasions and in just about every size, shape and packaging. There's Breyers Natural Vanilla to eat with apple pie; cheap and cheerful Popsicles on sticks for youngsters; Magnum Bites in small portions to satisfy late-night cravings; and pints of Ben & Jerry's or Talenti for something more extravagant. Sales have soared during the coronavirus pandemic, as families forced to eat at home turn to ice cream to indulge themselves. Sales of Unilever ice cream eaten at home increased by 26% between April and June, and by 16% in the following quarter, compared to the previous year, offsetting a collapse in treats consumed on the go.Lockdowns have also driven millions more people to buy groceries online, ice cream included. That's delivered a shot in the arm to Unilever's e-commerce business and paved the way for its newest market: ice cream on demand.How to make the good stuffMaking ice cream is tricky enough, without adding the logistics of getting it to people whenever they want before it melts.The ice cream business has changed since Wall's started factory production nearly 100 years ago. Now, companies have nearly limitless ways in which to combine milk, cream and sugar with other ingredients to come up with new flavors and formats. Unilever sells 431 different varieties of ice cream just in the United Kingdom and Ireland, while Magnum alone comes in about 35 flavors a year in standard sticks, mini sticks, pints and truffles.Andrew Sztehlo, Unilever's global vice president for ice cream research and development, likens the manufacturing process to a vehicle assembly line. Take the Cornetto, which combines Vanilla ice cream with chocolate coating and hazelnut pieces in a wafer cone.Cornetto ice cream cones in a freezer in Bangkok, Thailand in December 2019.""Making a Cornetto is the food equivalent of making a motor car,"" he told CNN Business. ""You've got hot things, cold things, things that are at funny angles, things that like water, things that hate water. And they've all got to come together to make this cone. It's very complex and it goes at high speed.""Even with all this precision and years of experience, technical challenges persist. According to Chris Veitch, a former senior process engineer at Unilever, there are projects every year to try and fix the problem of Cornetto cones occasionally going soggy within their use-by dates.""Ice cream is an incredibly complex material that's very difficult to model and work with, and there are several highly sensitive processing steps that affect quality,"" Veitch said in a briefing earlier this year hosted by the London-based Institution of Chemical Engineers.That means that whenever Unilever wants to launch a new ice cream or even tweak an existing product by, for example, injecting sauce a little differently, it more often than not has to come up with a new piece of equipment. Hence why there's ""a lot of stainless steel"" and a lot of engineers in Unilever's ice cream factories, according to Sztehlo, who described them as ""Willy Wonka territory.""""There's lots of whirling things going up and down, in and out, and so on,"" he added. ""We make billions and billions of ice cream products every year in this way through our factories around the world.""Twister ice cream lollipops on an assembly line in a Unilever factory in Konya, Turkey.On a missionUnilever executives say they haven't strayed from Wall's strategy of making ice cream as ubiquitous as possible. Beyond getting a Wall's display case into every possible grocery store, that extends to eliminating the need for people to go out and find ice cream in the first place. ""I suppose as an ice cream gang we're a bit messianic,"" said Close. ""We believe that people want it, we've just got to find a way to get it to them.""Making ice cream available on demand is a key part of Unilever's efforts to reduce its reliance on summer sales, which leaves it vulnerable to changing weather conditions and with a narrow window to earn the bulk of its revenue. ""For Unilever, this has meant repositioning ice cream as an any time snack,"" Euromonitor said in a report earlier this year. A century after Wall's tricycles first hit the roads, the need to make ice cream available at all times means Unilever is once again using workers on wheels to distribute its wares.Ice Cream Now, the company's home delivery business, has boomed during the pandemic. What began as a pilot program in 2016 at Deliveroo's London headquarters with a single freezer and virtual store, is now available in more than 100 cities across 36 markets through partnerships with the likes of Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub (GRUB), Just Eat (JSTTY) and Domino's Pizza (DMPZF).Magnum ice cream boxes in a hypermarket in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in June 2019. Customers can get ice cream delivered within 30 minutes from any number of retail partners, restaurants or cloud kitchens. ""It's about getting ice cream out of [one of those freezers and] into somebody's house,"" Sztehlo said. And it's not stopping at bicycles. The company has teamed up with Terra Drone Europe to explore delivery by air.  It helps that Unilever's ice creams are already in several million freezers around the globe as part of its traditional business. It's grown pickup points for on-demand ice cream to 11,000 globally, an almost four-fold increase since before the pandemic hit. And it's adding more pickup points all the time to get ice cream to people as fast as possible — crucial for a product that starts to melt at anything above zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius).As an ice cream gang, we're a bit messianic. We believe people want it, we've just got to find a way to get it to them.""Matt Close, UnileverGlobal e-commerce sales of ice cream and frozen desserts were already growing strongly before the coronavirus. But the pandemic is accelerating the shift towards online grocery shopping, benefiting Unilever and rivals with e-commerce businesses, including Halo Top and Häagen-Dazs.There's room to grow. Euromonitor estimates that online sales of ice cream, including frozen yogurt, will reach around $1.7 billion this year — a small fraction of the $76.4 billion in overall ice cream sales to consumers.  For Unilever, the growth of ice cream at home, led by brands including Ben & Jerry's and Magnum, is on track to more than offset the collapse in its out of home ice cream revenue this year, which includes sales to restaurants and catering companies.The company has also benefited from some good luck. About two months before much of the world was thrust into coronavirus lockdowns, Ben & Jerry's launched Netflix & Chilll'd, a new peanut butter ice cream flavor with near-perfect messaging for 2020.Ben & Jerry's Netflix & Chilll'd is a peanut butter ice cream with sweet and salty pretzel swirls and fudge brownies.With the path of the pandemic still highly uncertain and some major economies going back into lockdown, Unilever now faces the daunting task of deciding what approach to take next year. Should it make more tubs of Carte d'Or for home consumption or Magnum singles to be eaten on the go? Plans for 2021 are ""a work in progress,"" according to Sztehlo, who joined the ice cream business as an apprentice 35 years ago. He admits that it's been more difficult to come up with the next big idea over video calls, particularly without afternoon office tastings. Those casual gatherings ordinarily take place around a table in New York where 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of different sorts of ice cream are passed around, but they're on hold until further notice. ""We've been missing the social, creativity, interactive moment. That's a bit more sterile,"" he said. The good news, he added, ""is that people want to be happy,"" and they are looking for ways ""to increase their moments of happiness at home.""

"Forces from Ethiopia's Tigray region bombed Eritrean capital, Tigray leader says","Rebellious forces from Ethiopia's Tigray region fired rockets at the airport in Eritrea's capital Asmara on Saturday evening, their leader said on Sunday, confirming earlier reports of a major escalation in a 12-day old conflict in Ethiopia.""Fighting is still continuing on several fronts"" in Ethiopia, Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters in a text message.Five regional diplomats told Reuters shortly after the attack that at least three rockets were fired at Eritrea's capital from Ethiopia on Saturday night. At least two of the rockets hit Asmara airport, three of the diplomats said. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive in the restive Tigray northern region on November 4, after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking federal troops based in the northern region, which borders Eritrea and Sudan.Why are there fears of civil war in Ethiopia?His government says the Ethiopian military has been carrying out air strikes in an attempt to destroy equipment including arms depots controlled by the insurgents.Read More""Our campaign in the Tigray Region to uphold rule of law is progressing well,"" Abiy said in a tweet on Sunday. ""Those who are committing crimes against humanity and peace will be held accountable."" ""Thanks to the exception valor and commitment its [sic] sons and daughters, Ethiopia is more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself,"" he added. The Tigrayan leader Debretsion, communicating by text message, also said that his forces have been fighting ""16 divisions"" of the Eritrean army ""on several fronts"" for the past few days. He did not give an estimate for how many troops he believes Eritrea has deployed. Eritrea has a vast standing army which the United States' CIA puts at 200,000 personnel.He said Eritrean forces have crossed into Ethiopia at Badme, Rama and Zalambessa, three border towns in the restive northern region.""Our country is attacking us with a foreign country, Eritrea. Treason!"" he told Reuters in a text message.There was no immediate comment from the Ethiopian government on Debretsion's claim of the strikes on Eritrea or other comments.Eritrea's government has denied involvement in the conflict. Officials in Asmara were not immediately reachable after the strikes.Debretsion said on Tuesday that Eritrea had sent troops over the border in support of Abiy's government, but provided no evidence. Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed denied this at the time, telling Reuters: ""We are not part of the conflict.""Mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's Tigray region, says Amnesty InternationalAt about 7.50 p.m. local time on Saturday, a series of loud noises were heard in Asmara, said the United States' embassy in Eritrea.""Unconfirmed reports indicate they may have been explosive devices believed to be in the vicinity of the Asmara International Airport.  There are no indications the airport was struck,"" said the embassy  in a statement on Sunday. ""All U.S. Citizens in Asmara are advised to exercise caution, remain in their homes, and conduct only essential travel until further notice.""Since the violence began on November 4, more than 14,500 refugees have fled Ethiopia into Sudan, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Services for 96,000 Eritrean refugees inside Tigray have been disrupted and there are reports of growing numbers of Ethiopians becoming displaced internally, the UN added. ""General living and operating conditions inside Tigray are becoming more difficult with power outages and food and fuel supplies becoming extremely scarce,"" said the agency's global spokesperson, Babar Baloch, at a press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva on Friday. ""Communications have been cut off creating an information black out.""A large number of civilians have been brutally killed, said Amnesty International on Thursday. The reported killings occurred in Mai-Kadra, a town in the region's south-west, on the night of November 9, according to the international NGO.The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said in a statement on Saturday that it was closely monitoring the risk of human rights violations arising from the ongoing war.

Donald Trump lashes out in new bid to tarnish an election he lost ,"President Donald Trump flexed the power of his office Tuesday to tarnish America's free and fair election, sacking the official who declared the vote the most secure in US history, even as more of his false claims of massive fraud were exposed as baseless in court.The revenge firing, the President's latest assault against the infrastructure of US democracy, comes as he refuses to accept his defeat and to begin the process of transitioning power to President-elect Joe Biden -- an impasse that is especially dangerous amid a worsening pandemic.Trump wrote that he terminated Chris Krebs, a senior Department of Homeland Security official, for contradicting his own baseless allegations of irregularities. The President, his campaign and political allies have made multiple efforts, which started well before the election, to falsely argue that he was cheated out of a second term. His effort appears motivated by a desire to explain away his clear defeat by the former vice president but is also part of a pattern of behavior designed to discredit Biden's presidency and to enshrine national divides that he consciously widened as a tool of power.Trump White HouseUS military anticipates Trump will issue order to plan for further troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and IraqTop Trump adviser moves closer to accepting Biden win: 'Obviously, things look that way now'Trump aims to undermine Biden's legitimacy even as legal challenges fizzleMAP: Full election resultsIn other apparent attempts to cast doubt on the integrity of the election -- unprecedented in modern history -- Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham was embroiled in a controversy after calling election officials in Nevada, Arizona and Georgia -- three key states won by Biden -- to question them on procedures for mail-in ballots, which generally favored Biden. And two Republicans broke with tradition in Michigan, another state where the Democratic nominee triumphed, in temporarily blocking the certification of the election in Wayne County, where Biden beat the President. Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, later told CNN's Chris Cuomo that the officials relented and agreed to certify the vote. The latest maneuvers by Trump and his allies came as more of the President's long-shot legal challenges and threadbare cases alleging election fraud were exposed in the courts.Read MoreThe President's latest Hail Mary attempt to overturn the election result in one of the multiple states won by Biden came unstuck, this time in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.The Keystone State's top bench ruled that there was nothing in state law requiring ballot observers to stand within six feet of vote counts as the Trump campaign had argued. The decision undercuts the President's claim his supporters were unfairly discriminated against and that therefore the results in Pennsylvania, where Biden won by tens of thousands of votes, should be ruled invalid.In a separate Pennsylvania case, Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani stepped in to lead a chaotic legal effort trying to prove that Democrats committed election fraud over absentee ballots. Other judges have previously rejected such claims.Another of Trump's all but non-existent openings to change the election result championed by conservative media also appeared to be closing.An election audit in Georgia was expected to finish by Wednesday ahead of the official certification of the ballot  on Friday. Officials said the results were largely tracking original tallies that handed victory to Biden, further tarnishing Trump's claims of widespread fraud.Trump cancels Thanksgiving trip Trump remains bunkered in the White House as the world spins onAs more and more states begin to certify their election results in the coming days, the already minuscule rationale for Trump and the White House to perpetuate the fiction that he won a second term will further recede. There are so far no signs that Republican state legislators in some key states are ready to fulfill the hopes of some conservative pundits that they will disregard the will of voters and select pro-Trump delegations to the Electoral College. Trump's setbacks in his struggles to overturn the results comes as he has all but retreated from public view.CNN's White House team reported on Tuesday that the increasingly reclusive commander in chief -- who once couldn't bear to cede the limelight -- is locked in a ""bunker mentality.""In no mood to party, Trump has decided to forgo his normal Thanksgiving trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort, administration officials told CNN, and he has had no public engagements for days.But even an invisible, lame-duck President retains the power to change the world that his successor will confront. So, Trump's acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller announced Tuesday that thousands of troops would be pulled out of Afghanistan and Iraq, as first reported by CNN's Barbara Starr the day before. The move prompted a mixed reaction from Capitol Hill, but notably drew criticism from Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Another senior Republican senator, John Cornyn of Texas, issued a scathing statement about the move, saying that it came without any real consultation with US allies, NATO or Congress and would draw down troops to ""a potentially unstable and dangerous level.""The decision fulfilled one of the President's political goals but will spark fears of a Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan. It also went against the advice of US commanders who worry about the strength of the democratic government in Kabul.The redeployment announcement was just one of what are expected to be a series of aggressive plays by the President -- possibly including moves on Iran and China policy -- and attempts to tie Biden's hands when he is President. Trump's use of his power to make such significant moves while refusing to explain them to the American people as he stays out of sight, and the impression that he is exacting vengeance for a defeat he will not accept, are likely to further undermine his position.New fears about vaccine delays Trump scores a long-awaited coronavirus win with vaccines on the wayThe potential cost at home of the President's obstinacy and failure to sign off on millions of dollars of transition funding, access to government agencies and briefings for Biden's team is becoming ever more clear.Hugely encouraging news about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines expected to be available to all Americans next year cannot disguise growing anxiety among medical experts at the failure to read the next administration into the program.The vaccine effort will be one of the most complicated logistical and public health undertakings ever. Any delays in manufacturing and distributing the vaccine could result in thousands of unnecessary deaths.Growing desperation about the worsening human toll of Covid-19 prompted several big US medical groups to call for cooperation between the outgoing and incoming administrations on Tuesday.""All information about the capacity of the Strategic National Stockpile, the assets from Operation Warp Speed, and plans for dissemination of therapeutics and vaccines needs to be shared as quickly as possible to ensure that there is continuity in strategic planning so that there is no lapse in our ability to care for patients,"" said the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association in a joint letter to Trump.In a sign of the complexity of the task ahead, a Government Accountability Office review of the Trump administration's vaccine effort found several choke points that could slow the approval and distribution of vaccines.And the government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been marginalized by the President, stressed that presidential transitions are vital.""If you don't have a smooth transition, you would not optimize whatever efforts you're doing right now,"" Fauci told CNN's Jim Sciutto.Trump's neglect is having a devastating impact as hospitalizations from Covid-19 reach record levels and the virus blasts through Midwest and Mountain West states where Republican governors and voters bought into Trump's minimization of the pandemic and contempt for masks and social distancing.Biden presses on Here's who could serve in top roles in the Biden administrationBiden, who has called Trump's failure to concede and to open a formal transition of power an ""embarrassment,"" is pressing on with his efforts to prepare his administration. In Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday the former Vice President consulted US national security experts and former military brass. The group included retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who resigned during the Obama administration after Rolling Stone magazine reported remarks in which he criticized the former vice president.Biden said that it would be preferable to have access to the normal intelligence briefings that Presidents-elect enjoy. But he is promoting an image of a commander in chief who is ready to get to work.Capitol Hill Republicans are still unwilling to confront the President on his refusal to permit a graceful transition. But increasingly there are signs that the natural transfer of power -- if it is not happening formally -- is under way.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio referred to Biden as President-elect this week. McConnell has made a career of not getting his caucus out ahead of political conditions, but he also gently recognized inevitability of what is to come.""We're going to have an orderly transfer from this administration to the next one,"" McConnell said. ""What we all say about it is, frankly, irrelevant.""Even noting such minor rhetorical shifts highlights the President's outlandish behavior and his own party's willingness to confront it. But it is a sign that reality is also coming into focus.",2020-11-18T05:01:15Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/politics/donald-trump-transition/index.html,2020-11-18 09:03:12.786292,CNN,politics,0
Trump bans Americans from investing in Chinese firms he claims have ties to the military,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order banning Americans from investing in Chinese firms that the administration says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military. The order applies to 31 Chinese companies which it says ""enable the development and modernization"" of China's military and ""directly threaten"" US security.Smartphone maker Huawei and Hikvision, one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of video surveillance equipment, are among the blacklisted companies. Some of the other companies listed, including China Telecom and China Mobile, trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Trump's order bans US investors from owning or trading any securities that originate or are exposed to those firms. This includes pension funds or owning shares in the companies that are banned. Investors will have until November 2021 to divest from the companies. Shares in Hikvision dropped more than 4% in morning trade in Shenzhen on Friday, before paring back some of those losses to fall 1.5%. Shares in China Telecom (CHA) plunged 7.8% and China Mobile (CHL) was down 5% in Hong Kong. Huawei is a private firm. Read MoreHikvision said on Friday that the decision to pursue the company is ""groundless."" ""As we have shown time and again, Hikvision is not a 'Chinese military company'. Hikvision is independently operated and publicly traded,"" the company said in a statement. Hikvision added that it has never participated in any research and development work for military applications.""These punitive actions against the company do not make America, or the world, any safer,"" the company said.China Telecom said in a stock market filing that it was ""currently assessing the impact"" of the executive order, which could cause its share price to fluctuate.Huawei and China Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday blasted the executive order, saying that the US government ""maliciously slandered"" legitimate collaboration between China's military and civilian companies and ""unreasonably suppressed Chinese companies.""""This move will not only seriously damage the legitimate interests of Chinese companies, but will also damage the interests of investors in various countries, including the United States,"" spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters.The executive order, set to take effect January 11, comes as trade and technology battles are heating up between the world's two largest economies. Many Chinese tech companies have come under pressure during the Trump administration. Over the past few years, Washington has taken aim at China's lofty tech ambitions, striking blows at the country's developing artificial intelligence, semiconductor and telecommunications industries. Trump's latest move is in line with what industry watchers such as Paul Triolo, head of geotechnology at consultancy Eurasia Group, expected from the lame-duck presidency. Beijing ""will be on guard for the Trump administration to take some hard parting shots at China, particularly actions against major Chinese tech companies,"" Triolo wrote in a note last week. ""But China will generally stay restrained in its retaliatory measures in order not to poison relations before [US president-elect Joe] Biden takes office on 20 January,"" he added.  The United States strikes a blow to China's AI ambitionsWashington officials earlier this year escalated sanctions on national tech champion Huawei, citing national security concerns. The US restrictions — which further cut off Huawei's access to vital American technology and supplies — have pushed the smartphone and telecommunications equipment maker into survival mode. Huawei has repeatedly said that its products do not pose a national security risk. Hikvision was also added to a US trade list barring access to American supplies late last year. The company had been condemned for working with authorities in Xinjiang who are accused of alleged violations of human rights against Uyghurs and other members of Muslim minority groups.Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Hikvision.",2020-11-12T21:50:17Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/investing/trump-bans-us-investments-china-military/index.html,2020-11-16 11:01:30.324630,CNN,technology,0
Alaska Airlines flight hits bear on runway during landing,"In an unusual collision, an airplane hit and killed a brown bear while landing at the Yakutat Airport in Alaska on Saturday. Alaska Airlines Flight 66 was arriving from Cordova into Yakutat when the flight crew saw two bears crossing the runway, according to a statement by Alaska Airlines. ""The nose gear missed the bears, but the captain felt an impact on the left side after the bears passed under the plane,"" the airline's statement said. Pilots then spotted a bear lying several feet off the center of the runway while taxiing the Boeing 737-700 aircraft for parking. The left engine cowl of the plane was damaged in the collision and maintenance technicians are currently working to repair the aircraft. Six passengers were on the flight at the time, but no injuries were reported.The Boeing 737-700 is being repaired before returning to service, Alaska Airlines said.After being informed of the incident, airport maintenance and operations crews removed the bear's carcass and brought it to a storage warehouse, according to Sam Dapcevich, a public information officer for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. Read MoreThe Alaska Department of Fish and Game was contacted to arrange for proper disposal of the bear.""It's a rare occurrence for something like this to happen,"" Dapcevich told CNN. ""I've been in Alaska my whole life and we've had aircraft strike birds and other animals ... but this is the first instance of a bear that I've ever heard of.""The airport is partially fenced. The airport's operations crews are trained by the US Department of Agriculture to use pyrotechnics and vehicles to deter animals from coming near the runway and interfering with aircraft operations, Dapcevich said. Crews had previously seen two bears in the area and believed them to be a female bear and a cub. On the day of the incident, crews had not seen any wildlife during snow removal operations, according to Dapcevich.  Animal tracks seen at Yakutat Airport on Sunday, one day after the accident.Local photographer and biologist Robert Johnson said he was surprised by the incident. He went out to capture the scene after speaking with his neighbors who were passengers on the flight.""It was an unusual occurrence, actually a first in Alaska at least,"" Johnson told CNN. ""I've worked with bears most of my adult life up here.""In 1987, another unlikely collision occurred between wildlife and an Alaska Airlines airplane -- but that aircraft hit a fish. An Alaska Airlines flight was departing from Juneau when a large fish hit the Boeing 737-200 aircraft just behind the cockpit window. An eagle that had crossed paths with the flight had been gripping the fish in its talons.""In the process, the eagle either voluntarily released its meal or the rapid turn ripped it out of its claws,"" Anchorage-based Alaska Airlines pilot Captain Mac af Uhr wrote in a 2005 story about the incident, according to an Alaska Airlines blog post. Dapcevich said it was too soon to say what steps would be taken to prevent a rare incident like the bear collision from happening in the future.

US military anticipating Trump will issue order to plan for further troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq,"US military commanders are anticipating that a formal order will be given by President Donald Trump as soon as this week to begin a further withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq before Trump leaves office on January 20, according to two US officials familiar.The Pentagon has issued a notice to commanders known as a ""warning order"" to begin planning to drawdown the number of troops in Afghanistan to 2,500 troops and 2,500 in Iraq by Jan 15, the officials said. Currently there are approximately 4,500 US troops in Afghanistan and 3,000 troops in Iraq.The Pentagon and White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Hollyanne Milley, wife of top US general, saves vet's life who collapsed during Veterans Day ceremonyWhile Monday's news indicates that the Pentagon appears ready to remove thousands more US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, it also suggests that Trump may fall short of fulfilling one of his core promises to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan before he leaves office.On October 7 Trump tweeted: ""We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!""  Read MoreThen-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper sent a classified memo earlier this month to the White House asserting that it was the unanimous recommendation of the chain of command that the US not draw down its troop presence in Afghanistan any further until conditions were met, sources familiar with the memo tell CNN.The assessment from the chain of command -- Esper, US Central Command leader Marine Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie and commander of NATO's mission in Afghanistan Gen. Austin Miller -- stated that the necessary conditions had not been met. Others agreed, sources tell CNN, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.The memo is believed to have been one of the main reasons why Trump fired Esper last week.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not criticize Trump directly Monday while discussing the drawdown plans but warned of the potential ramifications of a rapid withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, saying it would ""hurt our allies.""""We're playing a limited -- limited -- but important role in defending American national security and American interests against terrorists who would like nothing more than for the most powerful force for good in the world to simply pick up our ball and go home,"" he said in a speech from the Senate floor.""There's no American who does not wish the war in Afghanistan against terrorists and their enablers had already been conclusively won,"" he said. ""But that does not change the actual choice before us now. A rapid withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan now would hurt our allies and delight -- delight -- the people who wish us harm.""The decision to pull additional troops out of Iraq comes as the Trump administration has moved to reduce the US military's footprint there in recent months.The US commander in the Middle East announced a drawdown of US troops in Iraq from 5,200 to 3,000 in September.  In March, US forces began pulling back from bases across Iraq, turning them over to Iraqi security partners. At the time, Pentagon officials insisted that the base hand-offs were part of a long-planned consolidation that reflected the success of the anti-ISIS fight -- not concerns over the ongoing rocket attacks by Iran-linked proxy militias.Sweeping changes at the Pentagon US military officials have long stressed that the US withdrawal from Afghanistan should be conditions based, including the Taliban breaking its ties to al Qaeda and making progress in peace talks with the Afghan government, two conditions that have yet to be met.But despite the lack of progress, the Trump administration has already substantially reduced US troops in the country by more than 50%, recently bringing the number of US military personnel there down to about 4,500, the lowest levels since the earliest days of the post 9/11 campaign.Trump made bringing American troops home a theme of his reelection campaign but the future of US forces in Afghanistan has remained uncertain amid the mixed messages coming from the administration. National security adviser Robert O'Brien has advocated for a more accelerated withdrawal from Afghanistan irrespective of conditions on the ground, something made more feasible by the installation of White House loyalists in senior defense posts.Trump administration removes senior defense officials and installs loyalists, triggering alarm at Pentagon  Milley had pushed back on an earlier announcement from O'Brien suggesting an aggressive timeline for troop withdrawals that appeared to be irrespective of conditions.""Robert O'Brien, or anyone else, can speculate as they see fit, I am not going to engage in speculation, I'm going to engage in the rigorous analysis of the situation based on the conditions and the plans that I'm aware of in my conversations with the President,"" Milley told NPR on October 11.Sweeping changes at the Pentagon last week have put Trump loyalists in place and knowledgeable sources told CNN's Jake Tapper last week that the White House-directed purge at the Defense Department may have been motivated by the fact that former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and his team were pushing back on a premature withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met.Those changes included installing an ardent opponent of the US military's presence in Afghanistan, who once called for the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants and has made a litany of racist comments, as a senior adviser at the Pentagon.A Pentagon spokesman confirmed Wednesday that retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor ""will be serving as a Senior Advisor to the Acting Secretary of Defense. Mr. MacGregor's decades of military experience will be used to assist in the continued implementation of the President's national security priorities.""Macgregor has been a vocal opponent of the US military's mission in Afghanistan and has called for a total withdrawal of US troops and the American Embassy despite the continued presence of terrorist groups there.Hollyanne Milley, wife of top US general, saves vet's life who collapsed during Veterans Day ceremonyRepublican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky who is a strong advocate of withdrawing US troops welcomed the appointment.""I am very pleased @realDonaldTrump asked my friend Col. Doug Macgregor to help quickly end the war in Afghanistan. This and other picks for Pentagon are about getting the right people who will finally help him stop our endless wars,"" Paul tweeted.Trump also fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper last week in a tweet, replacing him with Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center.In one of his first moves as acting Defense Secretary, Miller sent a seemingly contradictory message to the force on Friday, saying the US must continue its battle against al Qaeda and the terrorist forces behind 9/11 while also saying it was time to bring troops home.""This war isn't over,"" Miller wrote in his message. ""We are on the verge of defeating al Qaida and it's associates, but we must avoid our past strategic error of failing to see the fight through to the finish.""""Indeed, this fight has been long, our sacrifices have been enormous, and many are weary of war -- I'm one of them -- but this is the critical phase in which we transition our efforts from a leadership to supporting role,"" he wrote in reference to the current US role of supporting counterterrorism campaigns such as the one in Afghanistan.""All wars must end. Ending wars requires compromise and partnership. We met the challenge; we gave it our all. Now, it's time to come home,"" Miller added.State Department officials unaware of Pentagon orderO'Brien and US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad are expected to discuss the troop drawdown plans during a meeting Monday, two State Department officials told CNN. Khalilizad recently returned to Washington from a trip to Turkey where he met with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and other Turkish officials. They discussed mutual concerns about the levels of violence in Afghanistan, according to a readout from the State Department.State Department officials knew it was possible Trump could order an additional troop drawdown in Afghanistan but did not know that the Pentagon had sent this warning order, two State Department officials said.Some State Department officials believed that because Trump did not order further troop withdraws before the election it was unlikely that there would be more during the rest of his administration.But last month Khalilizad said the conditions will dictate further withdrawals.""If conditions are right, we are committed to withdrawing. But if the conditions are not right, we don't have to withdraw,"" Khalilizad said in an NPR interview at the time.This story has been updated with additional reporting Monday.CNN's Jake Tapper, Kylie Atwood, Vivian Salama, Alex Rogers and Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",2020-11-16T18:52:46Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/politics/trump-afghanistan-iraq-troop-drawdown-order/index.html,2020-11-17 10:37:55.748964,CNN,politics,0
"NFL is confronting racism, but are Black quarterbacks continuing to be stereotyped?","To his frustration, they talked about Patrick Mahomes' arm rather than his decision making as if brawn somehow mattered more than brain.Despite monetary success and awards, Black quarterbacks, past and present, say they still face an uphill battle against prejudice, especially when entering the league.   For quarterbacks who threw for more than 3,000 yards in 2019, three of the top four -- as ranked by passer rating -- were Black: Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson.   That leaves out their individual rushing efforts too, of which Jackson's was substantial, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for over 1,000 yards as well as throw for over 3,000 yards.That success has run over into 2020. Wilson's current passer rating is 119.5 which, if the season ended today, would be the third-best season passer rating ever.Russell Wilson is having the best season of any quarterback this year, holding a passer rating of 119.5.Read MoreThis NFL season's opening game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans featured two of the most exciting young talents in the game: 2018 league MVP and 2020 Super Bowl MVP Mahomes of the Chiefs and the Texans' Deshaun Watson.    Last year's league MVP Jackson joins the duo in this group of top Black quarterbacks, alongside veterans Wilson, Dak Prescott and reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year Kyler Murray.Prior to his devastating season-ending injury in week five, Prescott had been leading the league in passing yards, attempts and completions this season.Mahomes is the highest-paid player in the NFL, having signed a contract extension during the off-season with the Kansas City Chiefs reportedly worth nearly half a billion dollars.Mahomes recently signed a 10-year contract extension reportedly worth nearly half a billion dollars and, while not on that level, Watson has signed a $156 million four-year contract extension. Alongside Wilson, the trio are the top three highest earning players in the NFL.   Are we seeing a change in attitudes and treatment, or is the struggle still as prevalent as ever?Historic experience   Few know the battle African American quarterbacks have faced like Warren Moon. The 63-year-old Moon, is the only Black quarterback in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but didn't have an easy route into the league.    Having gone undrafted in 1978, Moon went to Canada, winning five consecutive Grey Cups -- the Canadian Football League title -- before he was given a chance in the NFL with the Houston Oilers in 1984, aged 28. He says what he experienced wasn't racism, but rather racial stereotyping stacked against him.    ""If it was racism then they [Black players] wouldn't be allowed to play the game at all,"" he told CNN. ""But the stereotype was that we can only play certain positions.    ""And the quarterback position was the position that a lot of people didn't think we could play for different reasons, whether it was the leadership, whether it was being able to think, be able to make critical decisions at critical times. You know, be the face of a franchise, all those different things that go along with being a franchise quarterback.""    Warren Moon is the only Black quarterback in the NFL Hall of Fame.While Moon believes things have improved for Black quarterbacks since he entered the league, has enough changed?    According to Pro Football Reference, when Tom Brady entered the NFL in 2000, eight of the 31 starting quarterbacks during each team's opening game of the season were Black.In 2020, 10 Black quarterbacks started for the now 32 teams in their respective first games. This was down to nine by week two after an LA Chargers team doctor accidentally punctured one of the quarterback Tyrod Taylor's lungs when attempting to administer a shot to Taylor's ribs.   When 60% of the league's players are Black, and 70% of the players identify as people of color, according to The Institute of Diversity and Equality in Sport, the number is significantly lower than it statistically should be.   In a response to CNN, the league in a statement said: ""There are a record-setting 10 starting Black quarterbacks this season. The two highest-paid players in the NFL are Black quarterbacks. The last two seasons' MVPs have been Black quarterbacks.""The NFL is undertaking short-, intermediate-, and long-term diversity identification initiatives for both non-football and football personnel to ensure more opportunities for African Americans in leadership management positions across the league.""  League entry   The battle for Black quarterbacks begins with entry into the NFL. According to a leading academic, Black quarterbacks have historically found it more difficult being drafted into the league than their White counterparts.   Dr. Judson L. Jeffries, a professor of African American and African studies at the Ohio State University, says Black quarterbacks have been historically perceived as less intelligent, seen instead as simply athletes.   ""The knock on Black quarterbacks was they didn't have the intellect or academics to play the position,"" he tells CNN. ""They could run, but when it comes to learning a playbook, reading defenses, learning sophisticated schemes, they weren't able to do that.""   A 2008 quantitative study by Jeffries and Matthew Bigler showed that ""draft experts buy into and perpetuate racial stereotypes about Blacks that adversely impact Black college quarterbacks' chances of matriculating to the National Football League.""    The study also said: ""Blacks are consistently rated more negatively in the areas of leadership and intelligence/decision making.""   A 2017 essay by Rockell Brown Burton, a professor of media, and Tristan F. Jones, a contributing writer and journalist, published in the book ""Africana Race and Communication,"" went as far to say that the ""study is evidence of the modernized social construction of Black quarterbacks by mass media, with a primary focus on their physical attributes and descriptions that better resemble auctioned slaves than chosen leaders of men.""   Though Jeffries thinks a lot has changed in the intervening 12 years since his study, he continues to have reservations about whether perceptions of Black and White quarterbacks are equal.   ""Now it appears in 2020, much to my surprise but much to my delight, that [prejudice] has dissipated significantly in terms of judging Black quarterbacks that way,"" he says.   ""However, here's the rub: Even though things have significantly progressed, a lot of scouts and coaches when they see an African American quarterback will immediately frame them as someone who is a great athlete, as opposed to someone who is a great quarterback.""   Jeffries cites the treatment Jackson received when he entered the league.   A Heisman Trophy winner as a sophomore at the University of Louisville, Baltimore Ravens' Jackson was seen by doubters as just a runner, rather than someone who could throw, make critical decisions and lead too.   Dr. Judson Jeffries, a professor of African American Studies at the Ohio State University, says Lamar Jackson's refusal to participate in run drills was ""huge"" for Black quarterbacks. At the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine, he refused to take part in run drills, such as the 40-yard dash, to draw people's attention to his passing ability.    Jeffries says Jackson's decision not to take part in running drills, especially the 40-yard dash, was a significant moment in NFL history.   ""That was huge,"" he says. ""In terms of standing his ground, verbally, and being vocal that [he is] a quarterback.   ""Coupled with that, [Jackson's decision to say] 'I am not going to participate in the kind of drills that will undermine my ability to be viewed as a quarterback and drafted as a quarterback.'""   In other words, Jeffries says, ""Don't draft me and then talk about me playing wide receiver or running back.""   Unfortunately for Jackson, teams that needed quarterbacks didn't want to take the risk.He fell to the final pick of the first round, where he was taken by the Ravens. Jackson was visibly distressed as he took to the stage to shake NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's hand. Some four other quarterbacks were taken ahead of him, none of whom have yet approached the same level of success -- including Josh Rosen, whose recent signing to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice squad marks his third team in three seasons.    The reigning NFL MVP, and only the second unanimous MVP in NFL history, Jackson has since proved the doubters wrong.   Lamar Jackson became the second unanimous NFL MVP in only his second season. A recent Sports Illustrated article about Jackson goes deeper into the Florida native's journey to the NFL and the structural barriers he faced as a young Black quarterback. The article speaks of the dedication and support of his mother and coach, and implies that without them he may not have reached the NFL as a quarterback.   Jeffries says he thinks others in a similar position to Jackson will be inspired and are ""more likely to stand their ground verbally,"" but ""the jury is still out to what degree they will actually take that stand that Lamar Jackson took.""   Jalen Hurts, a 2020 second round selection for the Philadelphia Eagles, went through a similar process after experiencing significant success in college.With Alabama, he reached the 2017 College Football Playoff title game as a true freshman and was the starting quarterback of the 2018 championship team. After losing playing time the following season to Tua Tagovailoa and winning the SEC title game as an injury replacement, Hurts transferred to Oklahoma and excelled. He finished second in the Heisman Trophy vote his senior year.Rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts faced question marks over his ability to be an NFL quarterback despite a successful college career.Despite all of this success at the quarterback position, at the 2020 NFL Combine, Hurts was asked by members of the media if he would consider changing positions. Hurts answered assuredly but respectfully: ""I've always been a team-first guy. But I think I'm a quarterback. I think that's that.""   And, as Mahomes discussed in a recent interview with GQ magazine, this focus on the athletic attributes of Black quarterbacks at the expense of decision-making doesn't end when a player is drafted.   ""In my first year, what annoyed me more than anything is that people thought it was just my arm,"" Mahomes said. ""Everybody just talked about my arm instead of talking about how I was making the right decisions, going to the right place.""    He compared his experience to that of Ravens quarterback Jackson. ""He threw for over 30 touchdowns, but everybody just wanted to talk about the runs.""    Scrutiny and prejudice    Having already been drafted in the first round of the 2018 Major League Baseball Draft, the 2019 NFL Draft's number one overall selection Kyler Murray repeatedly had his commitment to football questioned. This was despite firm assurances from Murray of his desire to play in the NFL.   Kyler Murray was named 2019 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.The scrutiny he faced for his leadership and football study work led to prominent figures, such as ESPN's Stephen A. Smith, to call it ""systemic racism."" In the same segment, former NFL defensive end Marcus Spears spoke of the way Murray had been picked apart by draft experts as ""play[ing] into the Black quarterback effect.""    Murray proved the doubters wrong by winning the 2019 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.     Murray was the first overall selection in the 2019 NFL Draft.The draft positions of some Black quarterbacks have raised some eyebrows. Mahomes and Watson were the second and third quarterbacks selected in the 2017 Draft, behind Mitchell Trubisky, a White quarterback and someone whose inexperience was brought into question. The Chicago Bears took him second overall.    Incidentally, Watson has said he thinks he would have been drafted higher had he not been labeled a ""dual threat"" quarterback -- a stigmatic indicator that a quarterback is more of a runner than a passer.   ""He's a dual threat, so he can't read coverages; he can't read defenses, he can't be accurate,"" Watson said during a quarterback conference run for Black players. In 2019, Daniel Jones -- a White quarterback from Duke -- was taken sixth overall by the New York Giants even though Dwayne Haskins, a Black quarterback of college football powerhouse Ohio State, was still available. The choice baffled many, with former pro Cris Carter saying he thought racial bias played a part in the decision.    ""I just can't go on without saying this: If Dwayne Haskins, as an African-American, goes to Duke and puts up those mediocre stats -- seventh in the conference. He's not drafted Day 1 or damn Day 2,"" Carter said on ""First Things First"" at the time.""So, when you start talking about 'a guy can't comprehend' -- that stuff is racial.""    Haskins was drafted 15th overall by rival Washington. Both in their second NFL seasons, Haskins and Jones have yet to turn around their struggling franchises, with Haskins benched after week four.The Giants were contacted by CNN but declined to comment.   After Daniel Jones (right) was drafted ahead of Dwayne Haskins (left) in the 2019 NFL Draft, some questioned whether the decision was racially motivated.Positions of power   In a 2019 article in ESPN's The Undefeated, Quincy Avery, who has worked with Black quarterbacks -- including Deshaun Watson and Jalen Hurts -- says that, in the past, ""overt prejudice"" limited the opportunities of Black quarterbacks.   ""Today it's systemic,"" he said. ""They are afforded opportunities, but they aren't allowed to be average because they don't have enough decision-makers who look like them.""   A 2015 study published in the Journal of Sports Economics found that between 2001 and 2009, when controlling for injury, age, experience, performance, team investment, backup quality and bye weeks, Black quarterbacks in the NFL were found to be 1.98 to 2.46 times more likely to be benched than their White counterparts.Avery said without Black coaches, coordinators and general managers, opportunities for Black quarterbacks are limited.   Mike Tomlin (right) is the longest serving Black head coach currently working in the NFL, having taken over as Pittsburgh Steelers head coach in 2007.According to the NFL's Diversity & Inclusion Report for 2020, of the 31 head coaches, coordinators and general managers hired between February 4 2019 and February 2 2020 only seven were men of color: one general manager, one head coach and five defensive coordinators.   During the same time period, six of the 31 departing head coaches, coordinators or general managers were men of color. This means the NFL only made a net gain of one person of color in one of these positions of power from 2019 to 2020.   Two general managers are Black and the Washington Football Team's Jason Wright is the NFL's first and only Black president. Only three of 32 NFL head coaches are Black, the same number as when the league adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003 which stipulated a team must interview a minority candidate before reaching a final decision. As recently as 2018, seven head coaches were Black.  The Washington Football Team president Jason Wright (right) is the first and only Black president of an NFL organization.As a result of the latest report, the Rooney Rule was amended in May this year. Teams will now be required to interview two minority candidates for head coaching positions, at least one minority candidate for coordinator vacancies and one external candidate for front-office positions.   In its response for comment, the NFL told CNN ""enhancements to [the] Rooney Rule will increase opportunities for growth, development, and advancement for minorities across all facets of the League and clubs, both for non-football employees and football personnel.""  The statement added: ""The league is also implementing universal data collection to gather diversity information from all 32 NFL clubs. This information includes demographic details by position such as race/ethnicity, gender, generation, and more.""  Positive change?  Moon, however, is positive about the direction the league is going, saying Black quarterbacks are now getting the opportunities he wasn't when trying to break into the NFL.    ""African American quarterbacks now are getting more opportunities than they ever have before,"" he says. ""And I think that's why you see so many of them flourishing in the league right now.""   The current crop of supremely talented African American quarterbacks, says Moon, are successfully changing people's perceptions of Black quarterbacks.    ""Somebody said success is when [you do] something other people want to copy. You see African American quarterbacks are doing very, very well,"" he says, reeling off the achievements of Wilson, Murray, Mahomes and Jackson.    ""When other teams see this, they say, 'I want to have a successful quarterback, maybe this is what I need.'    ""When African Americans have success, it's going to breed more opportunities for other African Americans. That's what you see going on right now.""    Moon knows that the work he and other quarterbacks, like Doug Williams -- the first Black quarterback to win the Super Bowl and to be named Super Bowl MVP -- paved the way.   Doug Williams was the first Black quarterback to lead his team to Super Bowl glory, doing so in the 1987 season. ""We also know that if we did well, if we played well at a high level, that is going to help the next generation of guys get more opportunities,"" he says.    ""And we sit down, we see the game flourishing at that position right now for African Americans. It makes us all proud.""    Eric Bieniemy, the Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator, himself an African American, believes it's time to end labels, and says current Black quarterbacks think so too.""All of these guys just want to be labeled as a football player,"" he said in an August press conference. ""They want to be labeled as a quarterback. They don't care about their skin color. ""They just want to make sure that they're representing and doing it the right way and providing a road map for the next upcoming young black African American.""In the aforementioned GQ interview, Bieniemy's quarterback Mahomes said: ""We're changing people's perspective, showing that no matter what race you are, you can go out there and play the position the right way, and win a lot of football games doing it.""",2020-10-29T10:01:21Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/sport/nfl-black-quarterbacks-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,2020-11-16 11:23:57.902700,CNN,sports,0

Taylor Swift speaks out about sale of her masters,"Taylor Swift is speaking out about Scooter Braun's sale of her masters. The singer took to Twitter on Monday to post a lengthy and emotional message about the music executive, who acquired the master recordings of her first six albums from her former label -- Big Machine Label Group in June 2019 -- despite her objections. At the time, Swift called the agreement her ""worst case scenario.""""As you know, for the past year I've been actively trying to regain ownership of my master recordings. With that goal in mind, my team attempted to enter into negotiations with Scooter Braun,"" Swift, who has more than 87 million followers on Twitter, wrote on social media.

Congresswoman-elect shocked by Republicans calling her 'Breonna' because of her Breonna Taylor mask,"Congresswoman-elect Cori Bush said Monday evening she was stunned and ""hurt"" when some Republicans addressed her as ""Breonna"" during new member orientation at the Capitol because she was wearing a mask with Breonna Taylor's name on it.""It did not seem like they were being malicious. They just did not know,"" Bush told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""But then after the next, and next, and the next, then I really started to feel hurt, because I'm like this has been a national movement ... the reports are between 15 and 26 million people protested up to July -- from June to July. How do you not know? And we claim ourselves -- we asked, we signed up -- to be leaders,"" she continued. A nurse and pastor turned progressive community leader, Bush will be Missouri's first Black woman to represent the state in Congress after winning her House seat, according to CNN's projection.""We have to know what is happening in our communities. Not only our communities, but what's happening in other communities, because that is how we keep our people safe.""Read MoreTaylor, a 26-year-old Kentucky EMT, was shot at least eight times by police after law enforcement officials broke down the door of her apartment in an attempted drug raid in March. Her death prompted the kind of soul searching about the role of police in society and systemic racism in the criminal justice system that many advocates have been urging for decades.Before new member orientation, Bush had tweeted a photo of herself wearing the mask with Taylor's name on it outside the Capitol with the caption: ""Change does not come from this place unless we bring it here ourselves.""""We're bringing change to the 117th Congress,"" she said.Bush expanded on that message Monday, telling Burnett that she explained to each GOP lawmaker that addressed her as ""Breonna"" who Taylor actually was.

""This city really needs to have these stories told in this way, about our social change agents to create change in our society,"" said Lyon. ""This is a time where we need to focus on our extraordinary diversity, and all the wonderful range of human beings who can make a significant change in our societies.""A journey that started in Brazili.Detroit is a follow-up to Lyon's first identity project, ""Somos Brasil,"" which lead him to Brazil to learn more about his family.For Lyon, the human atlas is an in-depth identity project.""The initial idea behind the human atlas was to do a really deep and significant portrait project to look at a photographic collation of a cohort of fascinating and powerful people working in social change,"" the photographer said.Lyon, whose works hang in the Smithsonian Institution, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Arts Council of Great Britain, says he was first drawn to Brazil to document his family history.""It was very much a father's journey to understand the country of his growing family,"" Lyon said.Lyon is married to a Brazilian woman and wanted to help his two children better understand their heritage.""It turned into something so much bigger, and the book and the exhibition traveled around the world,"" he said.Mark Davidoff, a Detroit businessman, met Lyon in 2017 and got a copy of his human atlas of Brazil, ""Somos Brasil"" (We Are Brazil).   ""The book about Brazil landed on the desk of Rip Rapson of Kresge Foundation in Detroit,"" Lyon said.

An artist paints a picture of DetroitSome 4.2 million people live in the Detorit metropolitan area. To decide who to feature in i.Detroit, Lyon asked a diverse group of locals to nominate people from their communities who represent the very best of service to society. The final list includes 100 people from all races, ages and backgrounds.Lyon worked with Family Tree DNA to analyze the DNA of the 100 Detroiters. He then traced their generational migration to the city and interviewed each one to record their personal stories.""You would have a deeper look at a group of remarkable people through their visual spoken and genetic information,"" the photographer said.After spending months in the city and getting to know some of these remarkable Detroiters, Lyon realized there are many misconceptions about the city.""It's very easy to go and take pictures of ruined spaces or empty factories, but that is so not the story,"" he said.Consuela Francesca Barber-Lopez is  executive director of AMANDLA, a civic group that works to improve community responses to crimes against children.""You need to go past the post-industrial decline and look at the much warmer and powerful way that people are co-authoring new futures,"" Lyon said.

US Coronavirus: Governors are left to manage the spread of Covid-19 cases as rates are projected to get worse,"State and local leaders have been left to manage the spread of Covid-19 as infections increase at unprecedented speed -- and as things get worse, their participation will likely be more important, experts say.For much of the pandemic, health experts have lamented the lack of a strong national response from the United States while state leadership has implemented measures and restrictions. And now, on the heels of the country adding 1 million cases in less than a week (the fastest it ever has), two former FDA commissioners said Sunday slowing the spread is ""now up to governors.""States enact more Covid-19 rules as the US hits 11 million cases""State and local actions, supported by improved treatments, can help build a bridge to vaccinations and more widespread immunity in 2021,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Mark McClellan wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. ""Americans are understandably tired of Covid, but accepting temporary restrictions now will help prevent even more painful personal and economic disruptions.""The former commissioners called on leaders to enforce measures like wearing masks, avoiding gatherings and maintaining social distancing as the winter holidays threaten to drive cases even higher. Already, more than 11 million people have been infected in the US and 246,217 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. And with more than 2,000 Americans predicted to die every day by January, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, coronavirus could become the single leading cause of death in the US on a daily basis, the dean of tropical medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine said.Read More""It's more than just heading in the wrong direction,"" Dr. Peter Hotez said while speaking Sunday with CNN's Ana Cabrera. ""We are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.""States take actionWith a daunting outlook for cases and hospitalizations in the upcoming months, states are implementing new measures to curb the spread. Oregon is set to begin a two week ""social freeze"" on Wednesday, which includes a series of measures to limit social gatherings, close restaurants and bars to in-person dining , and impose limits on the number of people that can gather for faith-based organizations, according to Gov. Kate Brown.The state of Utah has enacted a statewide mask mandate, while Ohio is enacting stricter mask mandates for businesses.Washington state enacts new restrictions, months after it was first in the US to confront Covid-19And Michigan announced high schools and colleges will shift to remote learning for three weeks, among other restrictions on social gatherings and businesses.Just in the city of Los Angeles, more than 1,000 people are in the hospital with the virus.""The good thing about where we are now is we're smarter than we were in March. We understand that this blanket kind of lockdown, which did the trick then, may not be the best way now,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. ""It's not about whether a store is open or not. It's about your and my behavior. It's about whether we think, 'Oh, I know that person, so I'm familiar with them. I can hang out with them ... Those things are what's causing the spread.""Hospitalization rates impact staff and patients of every illnessThe spike in cases has been followed by climbing hospitalizations, a metric that can put a strain on medical resources and signal danger for many patients. According to the Covid Tracking Project, nearly 70,000 people were hospitalized with the virus on Sunday.And many states set hospitalization records over the weekend. Wyoming reported its record in both hospitalizations and deaths with 202 and 17, respectively. The same day, Dallas County, Texas, said it saw a ""potential for record high hospitalizations.""Physician predicts 'unprecedented surge' in US Covid-19 cases after ThanksgivingAbout 20% of all emergency room visits in the county were for coronavirus symptoms for the week ending November 7, the Dallas County Health and Human Services said.Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University, told CNN that health care workers are watching their colleagues get sick, and they're ""worn out and tired and scared.""""We are looking at patients who can't see their families to say goodbye,"" she said. ""It's just the beeping of a machine, the sound of a ventilator.""She said the strain on hospitals impacts not just Covid-19 patients, but those dealing with other issues like cancer, heart attacks and strokes.'This winter will be hard'A candidate vaccine from US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its partner BioNTech is said to be more than 90% effective in preventing infection in volunteers, but that doesn't mean the year will return to normal, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said on Sunday.States waiting for answers from feds on coronavirus vaccine distribution""This winter will be hard. We will not have a big impact on the infection numbers with our vaccine this winter,"" he said.Sahin said that if all goes well, his company would start delivering the vaccine at the end of this year at the earliest, with the goal of delivering more than 300 million doses by April 2021. Speaking to the BBC, Sahin said it is ""absolutely essential"" that countries achieve a ""high vaccination rate until or before autumn, winter next year, which means all the immunization, vaccination, must be accomplished before next autumn."" He said he was confident this would happen due to ""a number of vaccine companies helping us increase the supply so that we could have a normal winter next year."" Health experts have expressed concern about the spread in winter months. As the temperature drops, flu season kicks up and people crowd indoors -- making infection more likely.CNN's Jenn Selva, Arnaud Siad, Melissa Alonso, Ben Tinker, Holly Yan and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.

"Covid-19 is sending Black, Latino and Native American people to the hospital at about 4 times the rate of others","Black, Hispanic and Native American people infected with Covid-19 are about four times more likely to be hospitalized than others, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows. In the eight-month period between March 1 to November 7, there were 70,825 hospitalizations reported to the CDC. While White and non-Hispanic Black people represented the highest number of hospitalizations, racial and ethnic groups were disproportionately impacted.The rate for Hispanic or Latino was approximately 4.2 times the rate of non-Hispanic White persons, according to the CDC data.The same was true for American Indian or Alaska Native and non-Hispanic Black people, who were hospitalized about 4.1 and 3.9 times the rate of non-Hispanic White persons, the CDC said. Covid-19 vaccine trials have been slow to recruit Black and Latino people -- and that could delay a vaccine The findings are consistent with reports that nonwhite Americans have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The number of Covid-19 cases among Black and Hispanic children and across all ages is higher than other groups. Black and Hispanic people infected with the virus also died at disproportionately higher rates over the summer.Read MoreHealth officials have sounded the alarm for months about this trend -- and public health experts say it won't change unless the very compounding factors that put these groups in disadvantage are addressed. ""We've learned a lot about how to treat this disease as well as more about how to prevent it with wearing masks and social distancing,"" said Dr. Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. ""The problem is that for people who still are having challenges with access to health care it doesn't mean things are getting better for them.""Some communities of color, including Latinos and African Americans, are often uninsured or distrust the health care system. They have higher rates of conditions like hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, which can lead to more severe reactions to Covid-19, Cooper said.Jarvis Chen, a social epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said more people of color have jobs where they can be exposed to the virus in areas like health care, food production and public transportation.If they get sick, many are afraid their health may impact their ability to financially support their families in the short and long-term. ""These are real situations that people have to deal with that impact the possibility that people feel like they don't have a choice in terms of being able to stay home even if they have symptoms that could be in fact Covid-19 symptoms,"" said Chen, whose research focuses on social inequalities in health. These variables affect whether you live, die or get help during the pandemicLearning that Black and Latinos were at a higher risk of Covid-19 complications has influenced some of the decisions that families are taking. Irene Skinner, who lives in Jefferson County, Alabama, has five daughters who are attending virtual classes to avoid getting exposed to the virus.""I don't want to take a chance and put myself at risk, nor my kids, nor my mother,"" Skinner told CNN affiliate WBRC.The county's population is about 43% Black, according to US Census data. There have been more than 26,000 positive Covid-19 cases in the county and 27% of them involved Black people. From the more than 400 people who have died of Covid-19 in Jefferson County about 48% were Black, according to data from county health and emergency management officials.Van Phillips, principal at the high school that one of Skinner's daughters attends, reached out to families to explain how Covid-19 disproportionately impacts Black and Hispanic people. Now, the school has the highest percentage of students learning from home, WBRC reported, citing data provided by Jefferson County Schools.""There are just some things that we have to do to save our lives,"" Phillips told WBRC.For Chen, the CDC's findings should be a wake-up call for health officials to think about the distribution of personal protective equipment, sensible sick pay policies and the potential distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine.""The demographics tell part of the story but they should really direct us to think about how do we target populations that will benefit the most in terms of protecting them,"" Chen said.",2020-11-17T02:04:08Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/health/cdc-black-hispanic-native-american-coronavirus-hospitalizations/index.html,2020-11-17 10:42:00.724264,CNN,politics,0
Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake ,"These days, teachers often face classrooms filled with yawning students who stayed up late snapping selfies or playing online games. For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don't use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.The analysis found ""a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,"" said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King's College London. Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.Kids can't sleep? 10 tips that will helpFew parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a ""strong and consistent association"" between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Read MoreSurprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was ""how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,"" many of us will probably recognize our own families' habits reflected in the statistics.Electronic bedroomA large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children's sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game. Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.How an early bedtime can have lasting effects on kidsCarter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.""Sleep is vital for children,"" said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. ""We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more."" Kansagra, author of ""My Child Won't Sleep,"" noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. ""It's hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.""Kansagra said it's possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. ""For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,"" he said.Practicing good sleep hygieneDr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child's healthy development, even though ""we don't know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.""In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. ""Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,"" said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own ""personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.""Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Sleep hygiene -- tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep -- include having a room that is quiet. ""And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,"" Kline said.One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation, which recommends at least 30 minutes of ""gadget-free transition time"" before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.

MotorTrend Car of the Year goes to tech-heavy Mercedes E-Class,"The Mercedes E-Class, a model line that includes everything from a two-door convertible to a high-horsepower performance station wagon, won this year's MotorTrend Car of the Year award.The E-Class impressed MotorTrend's staffers with its mixture of classic luxury and modern, hi-tech performance, the magazine said in its announcement. The Mercedes E-Class includes four-door sedans, two-door coupes and convertibles and wagons.Mercedes' win was surprising because the E-Class was not a completely new design but rather what's known in the auto industry as a ""mid-cycle refresh."" Automakers usually release an all-new, completely redesigned version of a car model every five years or so. In between, they do a major update, usually altering the appearance somewhat and perhaps offering new engine options and making other underlying changes.In this case, Mercedes' reworking of the E-Class changed it from a good car to one with really outstanding performance, style and comfort, according to MotorTrend's staffers.A sophisticated optional air suspension system provides a smooth ride but also good cornering performance, staffers said. The interior design mixes modern looking screens and vents with classic wood and leather, the report said.MotorTrend staffers were impressed with the interior design of the Mercedes E-Class, but not with its hard-to-use interfaces.Read MoreAlso surprising is the fact that this year's award was given to nearly every version of the car in the E-Class' current lineup. That includes the $54,000 Mercedes-Benz  E 350, with its small four-cylinder engine, the $112,500 Mercedes AMG E 63 S wagon with its 603-horsepower V8 and the two-door E-Class Cabriolet and Coupe. Both of the two-door models are also available in high-performance AMG versions. All versions of the car were, surprisingly, very good, according to MotorTrend. Usually, with that many widely different variations, at least some would fall flat, MotorTrend judges said.MotorTrend staffers were particularly impressed with the E-Class's driver assistance technologies, including its automatic braking function. Automatic braking, which will brake if the driver doesn't respond quickly enough to a car stopping ahead, is common in new cars today. But Mercedes' system also stops for cars and pedestrians during turning maneuvers, something most others don't..The E-Class also has side blind spot detection, another assistance feature that's commonly available on new cars. But Mercedes' system warns of cars and bicyclists that are approaching when the car is stopped and someone is about to open a door.Back after 20 years, the Land Rover Defender is named MotorTrend SUV of the YearOne technology feature that did not impress the automotive media company's staffers was the user interface system for drivers and passengers. The system can be operated by touching the display screen, using the touch-sensitive pad between the seats, sliding a thumb across tiny touch sensitive panels on the steering wheel or using voice commands. Using the system caused the driver to take their eyes off the road too often, according to MotorTrend's staffers. And the car's various functions required going through too many menus while the system's responses to inputs, particularly from the steering wheel controls, were inconsistent, they said.MotorTrend Group, which encompasses the print magazine, web site and video outlets, gives out annual awards for Car of The Year, SUV of the Year and Truck of the Year. The Land Rover Defender was named SUV of the Year in October, while the Truck of the Year has not been announced yet.To be eligible for the Car of the Year Award, a model line must be either all new or substantially changed for the 2021 model year.

Nicolai Geertsen: Defender scores 'miraculous' scissor kick after his bicycle kick rebounds off crossbar,"The Puskas Award is handed out by FIFA, world football's governing body, at the end of every calendar year for the best goal in the global game. And we might have just found 2020's winner.Nicolai Geertsen, playing for Danish side Lyngby BK, first sweetly struck a bicycle kick from a corner, only for his effort to ricochet off the crossbar. However, from the resulting rebound, the defender reacted quickest, jumping to acrobatically scissor kick the ball beyond the despairing goalkeeper. Geertsen's display of athleticism unsurprisingly garnered plenty of attention on social media, with many calling the race to find this year's winner of the Puskas Award over.

Huawei is dumping budget smartphone brand Honor,"Huawei has been battered by a long US campaign against the company. Now it is hunkering down for survival by selling off its budget smartphone business. A consortium of buyers said on Tuesday that it has acquired Huawei's Honor smartphone brand for an undisclosed amount of money. The buyers include more than 30 Chinese agents and dealers of the budget brand.   Huawei and the group of buyers said they struck the deal to help save Honor's supply chain, and protect consumers and sellers. The Trump administration has cut off the Chinese company's access to vital technology, such as chipsets and software for its smartphones and 5G telecommunications equipment. Washington says Huawei poses a national security threat, allegations the company has long denied. Huawei says 'survival is the goal' as US crackdown hammers its businessDitching Honor gives Huawei's main smartphone brand more of a fighting chanceIt is also a much needed reprieve for Huawei. Selling Honor means the embattled Shenzhen company can now free up resources to focus on its own brand of flagship smartphones, according to Nicole Peng, analyst at market research firm Canalys.Read MoreHuawei stockpiled inventory before the latest round of restrictions were announced earlier this year. Still, its rotating chief executive said at a conference in September that the company is in a ""difficult situation"" and ""survival is the goal.""""Survival means they need to make sure they have enough components to have business continuity for a longer period of time,"" said Peng. Offloading Honor will give Huawei's smartphone unit a bit of breathing room. ""It definitely will be much less burden on their shoulders,"" said Peng. ""They only have a limited supply of components. At least those can [now] be preserved for the higher end Huawei brand,"" she added. Huawei will not hold any shares or be involved in any business management or decision-making activities in the new Honor company, according to a company statement. Which means ""Honor should be able to source their own components ... [and] sign their own contracts,"" according to Peng. Huawei's sales growth slows as US sanctions biteIt is possible that US sanctions on Huawei could ease once President-elect Joe Biden takes office. But there is no guarantee that a Biden administration will roll back restrictions on the Chinese tech firm. Huawei's ""future and outlook is still very uncertain,"" said Will Wong, analyst with market research firm IDC. ""So they need to focus on what they have, and the best thing they have are the high-end models.""The company's flagship phones such as the P and Mate series sell for upwards of about 4,500 yuan ($683) and 6,400 yuan ($972), respectively. Honor phones are much cheaper — the latest 10X series starts at around 2,100 yuan ($319) and lower end Play phones sell for as little as 1,200 yuan ($183). Focusing on the flagship devices will help Huawei ""maintain their high-end brand image and also generate more revenue,"" said Wong. Losing Honor will hit Huawei's global smartphone rankingWithout Honor, Huawei's total smartphone sales will take a hit. Earlier this year, the company achieved its long-time goal and briefly became the world's top smartphone seller, helped by a slump in sales at rival Samsung. The achievement would not have been possible without Honor. For nearly the last two years, the budget brand has accounted for between 25% and 29% of Huawei's total smartphone shipments, according to data from IDC. Canalys, which uses a different method to calculate shipments, found that Honor accounted for 20% to 40% of Huawei's total sales.  In the second quarter this year, the period when Huawei eked out a win over its South Korean rival, Honor made up more than a quarter of the company's total smartphone sales, according to IDC and Canalys. Without the roughly 15 million Honor devices sold in the April-June quarter, Huawei would not have landed on top of the podium. Samsung already regained the top spot in the July-September quarter, with Huawei taking second place for global smartphone sales, according to IDC and Canalys. Without Honor phones, Huawei would have been bumped to the No. 3 spot, behind Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.

Nursing home and assisted living workers face Covid-19 surge — even as they grieve,"In the middle of the night, Stefania Silvestri lies in bed remembering her elderly patients' cries.""Help me.""""Please don't leave me.""""I need my family.""Months of caring for older adults in a Rhode Island nursing home ravaged by Covid-19 have taken a steep toll on Silvestri, 37, a registered nurse.Read MoreFacebook LiveJoin Judith Graham for a Facebook Live event on grief and bereavement during the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, Nov. 16, at 1 p.m. ET.  Submit questions in advance here.She can't sleep, as she replays memories of residents who became ill and died. She has gained 45 pounds. ""I have anxiety. Some days I don't want to get out of bed,"" she said. Now, as the coronavirus surges around the country, Silvestri and hundreds of thousands of workers in nursing homes and assisted living centers are watching cases rise in long-term care facilities with a sense of dread. Many of these workers struggle with grief over the suffering they've witnessed, both at work and in their communities. Some, like Silvestri, have been infected with Covid-19 and recovered physically -- but not emotionally.Since the start of the pandemic, more than 616,000 residents and employees at long-term care facilities have been struck by Covid-19, according to the latest data from KFF. Just over 91,000 have died as the coronavirus has invaded nearly 23,000 facilities. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)Prayers and grief counseling after Covid-19: Trying to promote healing in long-term careAt least 1,000 of those deaths represent certified certified nursing assistants, nurses and other people who work in institutions that care for older adults, according to a recent analysis of government data by Harold Pollack, a professor at the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago. This is almost certainly an undercount, he said, because of incomplete data reporting.How are long-term care workers affected by the losses they're experiencing, including the deaths of colleagues  and residents they've cared for, often for many years?  Edwina Gobewoe, a certified nurse assistant who has worked at Charlesgate Nursing Center in Providence, Rhode Island, for nearly 20 years, acknowledged, ""It's been overwhelming for me, personally."" At least 15 residents died of Covid-19 at Charlesgate from April to June, many of them suddenly. ""One day, we hear our resident has breathing problems, needs oxygen, and then a few days later they pass,"" she said. ""Families couldn't come in. We were the only people with them, holding their hands. It made me very, very sad.""Every morning, Gobewoe would pray with a close friend at work. ""We asked the Lord to give us strength so we could take care of these people who needed us so much."" When Kallon was struck by Covid-19, Gobewoe prayed for her recovery and was glad when she returned to work several weeks later. But sorrow followed in early September: Gobewoe's friend collapsed and died at home while complaining of unusual chest pain. Gobewoe was told that her death was caused by blood clots, which can be a dangerous complication of Covid-19.She would ""do anything for any resident,"" Gobewoe remembered, sobbing. ""It's too much, something you can't even talk about,"" describing her grief.In nursing homes and assisted living communities, minorities suffer most from Covid-19, research saysI first spoke to Kim Sangrey, 52, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in July. She was distraught over the deaths of 36 residents in March and April at the nursing home where she has worked for several decades -- most of them due to Covid-19 and related complications. Sangrey, a recreational therapist, asked me not to name the home, where she continues to be employed.""You know residents like family -- their likes and dislikes, the food they prefer, their families, their grandchildren,"" she explained. ""They depend on us for everything.""When Covid-19 hit, ""it was horrible,"" she said. ""You'd go into residents' rooms and they couldn't breathe. Their families wanted to see them, and we'd set up Zoom wearing full gear, head to toe. Tears are flowing under your mask as you watch this person that you loved dying -- and the family mourning their death through a tablet.""""It was completely devastating. It runs through your memory -- you think about it all the time."" Mostly, Sangrey said, she felt empty and exhausted. ""You feel like this is never going to end -- you feel defeated. But you have to continue moving forward,"" she told me.Three months later, when we spoke again, Covid-19 cases were rising in Pennsylvania but Sangrey sounded resolute. She'd had six sessions with a grief counselor and said it had become clear that ""my purpose at this point is to take every ounce of strength I have and move through this second wave of Covid.""""As human beings, it is our duty to be there for each other,"" she continued. ""You say to yourself, OK, I got through this last time, I can get through it again.""That doesn't mean that fear is absent. ""All of us know Covid-19 is coming. Every day, we say, 'Is today the day it will come back? Is today the day I'll find out I have it?' It never leaves you.""CVS, Walgreens to help distribute Covid vaccines to nursing homesTo this day, Silvestri feels horrified when she thinks about the end of March and early April at Greenville Center in Rhode Island, where up to 79 residents became ill with Covid-19 and at least 20 have died.The coronavirus moved through the facility like wildfire. ""You're putting one patient on oxygen and the patient in the next room is on the floor but you can't go to them yet,"" Silvestri remembered. ""And the patient down the hall has a fever of 103 and they're screaming, 'Help me, help me.' But you can't go to him either.""""I left work every day crying. It was heartbreaking -- and I felt I couldn't do enough to save them.""Then, there were the body bags. ""You put this person who feels like family in a plastic body bag and wheel them out on a frame with wheels through the facility, by other residents' rooms,"" said Silvestri, who can't smell certain kinds of plastic without reliving these memories. ""Thinking back on it makes me feel physically ill.""Silvestri, who has three children, developed a relatively mild case of Covid-19 in late April and returned to work several weeks later. Her husband, Michael, also became ill and lost his job as a truck driver. After several months of being unemployed, he's now working at a construction site.Since July 1, the family has gone without health insurance, ""so I'm not able to get counseling to deal with the emotional side of what's happened,"" Silvestri said.  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Although her nursing home put up a hotline number that employees could call, that doesn't appeal to her. ""Being on the phone with someone you don't know, that doesn't do it for me,"" she said. ""We definitely need more emotional support for health care workers.""What does help is family. ""I've leaned on my husband a lot and he's been there for me,"" Silvestri said. ""And the children are OK. I'm grateful for what I have -- but I'm really worried about what lies ahead at the same time.""  KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

'Big Sky' review: David E. Kelley takes a detour into the dark side of the heartland,"""Big Sky"" starts out feeling like another quirky drama -- a generation-later heir to David E. Kelley's ""Picket Fences"" -- before morphing into something much darker, which turns out to be pretty surprising and compelling once you get past the clunky and unpleasant task of setting it all up. Kelley -- the creator of shows like ""Ally McBeal"" and ""The Practice"" -- has more recently migrated to premium TV (see HBO's ""Big Little Lies"" and ""The Undoing""), which makes his broadcast return something of an occasion. ABC also gambled on the show, jumping straight to a series order -- bypassing the usual pilot process -- in a Covid-impacted program-development season.Here, the prolific writer is again working from a book, this time C.J. Box's ""The Highway"" novels. The story focuses on a pair of teenage sisters who get kidnapped in rural Montana, gradually peeling back layers to reveal a menacing, hidden underbelly of the heartland.A topnotch cast helps elevate the material, with Ryan Phillippe as Cody Hoyt, a private eye engaged in a mini-soap opera involving his estranged wife Jenny (Katheryn Winnick), an ex-cop, and his business partner Cassie (Kylie Bunbury). The three get drawn into the larger plot when the teens -- on a road trip to visit the Hoyts' son -- are snatched by a predator.File that sequence under the heading of ""Teenagers do dumb things in movies and TV,"" violating rules about strange truck drivers and turning off the main highway onto lonely back roads. The whole thing has an unfortunate, slightly uncomfortable slasher-movie vibe.Read MoreConcern about their disappearance brings the private investigators into contact with a local highway patrolman (the always excellent John Carroll Lynch), and begins to pull back the curtain on what a headline summarizes as rural Montana's ""abduction problem.""The pulpy, serialized plot has more of a cable texture, certainly compared to procedural network dramas. That said, the women-in-peril aspect is only one of the ways in which the set-up comes across as dated -- including a disturbing character (Brian Geraghty) with mommy issues -- veering closer to what feels like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" territory than the wide-open spaces.That's offset, to some extent, by the strength of the female characters, including Winnick (""Vikings"") and Bunbury (""Pitch""), who even engage in a bar brawl during the early going.The idea of dark secrets in small towns is as old as the hills (or the ""Twin Peaks), and ""Big Sky"" possesses its share of throwback qualities.Still, Kelley's writing deftly pulls the audience along from twist to twist, at least through the two episodes previewed. How well that bodes for the long haul remains to be seen, but at least out of the gate ""Big Sky"" gets considerable mileage out of this premise, turning a misguided detour into what looks like a very dark trip.""Big Sky"" premieres Nov. 17 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC and will be available the next day on Hulu.",2020-11-17T18:42:06Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/entertainment/big-sky-review/index.html,2020-11-18 08:49:37.811388,CNN,entertainment,0

Ethan Hawke learned a valuable lesson from River Phoenix's death ,"Ethan Hawke says River Phoenix's death is one of the reasons he never moved to Los Angeles.In an interview with The Guardian published Monday, Hawke spoke about working with the late Phoenix when they were both child actors.The pair appeared in the kids' film ""Explorers,"" which bombed, but Hawke said he learned a valuable lesson from knowing Phoenix, who famously died at the age of 23 of a drug overdose after collapsing outside of a West Hollywood nightclub.Hawke explained to the publication that he doesn't act in easier movies because ""my first screen partner overdosed on Sunset Boulevard, you know?""""He was the brightest light and this industry chewed him up, and that was a big lesson to me,"" Hawke said of Phoenix. ""If I had to put a single reason on why I never moved to LA, it would be I think it's too dangerous for an actor like me to be in that kind of climate.""Read MoreNow 50 years old and starring in ""The Good Lord Bird,"" about the famous abolitionist John Brown, Hawke can reflect back on his earlier career, which included losing out on a role in the film ""Stand By Me"" to Phoenix.""You're really good, but I just gave the part to another kid with a bird name,"" Hawke recalled ""Stand By Me"" director Rob Reiner telling him at the time.Hawke made clear his enormous respect for Phoenix, as he did for other actors he has worked with who also died too soon, including Robin Williams and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Hawke reflected on those loses during the interview.

China says relations with Australia are in 'a sharp downturn' -- and it's all Canberra's fault,"China has declared Australia must take the blame for ""a sharp downturn"" in relations between the two countries, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman saying all responsibility is on ""some people in Australia (who) tend to regard China's development as a threat.""Relations between Australia and China have been frosty for years, but the situation deteriorated rapidly after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in April called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.The Chinese government dubbed Morrison's proposal ""political manipulation."" From May onwards, lucrative Australian exports to China including wine, barley and beef have faced obstacles from China -- including high tariffs, anti-subsidy investigations and lengthy delays clearing customs.In September, the last two reporters from Australian news organizations in China had to be evacuated after they were aggressively questioned by authorities over a national security case involving Cheng Lei, an  Australian journalist working for Chinese state media.In an interview with Australian media published Sunday, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the ""ball is very much in China's court"" to resolve trade tensions, adding that he hoped the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement in the past week would help resolve the dispute between the two governments. Read MoreThe RCEP, which was signed on Sunday, is a huge trade agreement which brings together 14 countries in the Asia Pacific, including China and Australia, in a massive free trade deal.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian attends a news conference in Beijing on Aug. 28.But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian made it plain that there was no truce in sight during his daily news conference in Beijing Tuesday. Zhao said the Chinese government bore no blame for the breakdown in relations.""(They) have subsequently taken a series of wrong moves related to China, which is at the root cause of China-Australia relations taking a sharp downturn and stuck in the current difficult situation ... the responsibility for causing this situation doesn't lie with China at all,"" he said.Zhao described three areas in which Australia had displeased the Chinese government -- one of which was Morrison's decision to call for an international inquiry. ""(This) seriously interfered with international cooperation on pandemic prevention and control,"" he added.The spokesman denounced Australia for its attempts to crack down on alleged foreign interference in its domestic politics, a campaign Beijing believes was targeted at China.Zhao also berated Australia for repeatedly commenting on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese military's threatening behavior toward the self-governed island of Taiwan. ""These practices have grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,"" Zhao said.Speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Wednesday, Birmingham said Canberra wanted a ""mutually beneficial relationship"" with China -- which he said he had ""reinforced time and again.""""It doesn't mean that we will compromise at all in terms of our values, our security, our interests, but it does mean that the door is open from the Australian perspective,"" he said.""We have reached out at every possible level and pathway.""Zhao's comments came after Australia and Japan agreed ""in principle"" to a landmark defense treaty between the two countries, during a meeting in Tokyo between Prime Minister Morrison and Japanese leader Yoshihide Suga. Birmingham said Wednesday the deal should have ""no bearing"" on Australia's relationship with China. However it is the latest in a series of moves by Australia and Japan to deepen their military ties, with the Chinese government doubling down on its territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, as well as increasing military drills targeted at Taiwan.According to a statement from Morrison's office, the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) ""will facilitate greater and more complex practical engagement between the Australian Defense Force and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces"" and ""will also support our joint involvement in broader multilateral exercises.""In his first face-to-face meeting with Suga, Morrison thanked the Japanese Prime Minister's predecessor Shinzo Abe for six years of negotiation on the agreement.CNN's Sophie Jeong contributed to this article.",2020-11-18T07:28:16Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/australia/australia-china-japan-military-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-18 08:54:20.978572,CNN,world,0
Chris Krebs: Trump fires director of Homeland Security agency who had rejected President's election conspiracy theories,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired the Department of Homeland Security official who had rejected Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud. Trump announced on Twitter he was firing Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and directly tied it to Krebs' statement that said there ""is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""""The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud,"" Trump said in a tweet that also repeated other baseless conspiracy theories about the election and was flagged by Twitter as ""disputed.""""Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.""RELATED: CNN's live presidential election resultsRead MoreCNN reported that Krebs, who ran the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security, expected to be fired. A source close to Krebs told CNN he knew he might get in trouble for telling the truth, but realized his dismissal could come soon when media organizations that are friendly to the President started to attack him.He learned from Trump's tweet he had been fired, the source said, and responded on Twitter himself shortly afterward, saying, ""Honored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomrorow. #Protect2020.""CISA Deputy Director Matt Travis, the No. 2 official at the agency, resigned in the wake of Krebs' firing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Travis resigned after the White House made clear he would not take the helm at CISA. In a letter seen by CNN, CISA's chief of staff Emily Early informed the staff that Tuesday was Krebs' last day with the agency, and said the President has designated Executive Director Brandon Wales as acting director.""A change in leadership is not a change in mission and it is essential that we do not lose focus on the important work we collectively undertake on behalf of the American people,"" the letter stated. ""Fortunately, we have the best workforce in all of government and I know we can count on each of you to continue the excellent work you do every day as we all work together to Defend Today and Secure Tomorrow.""A source described Wales as a ""career former chief of staff, and counselor, who is highly respected by everyone.""Krebs' dismissal underscores the lengths Trump is willing to go to punish those who don't adopt his conspiratorial view of the election. Since CNN and other outlets called the race for President-elect Joe Biden, Trump has refused to accept the results, instead pushing baseless conspiracies that his second term is being stolen.This includes falsely claiming during an election night address that he had already won reelection, that he had won states that were actually still up in the air at the time and that his opponents were perpetuating a fraud.In the lead-up to the election, Krebs had often quietly disputed the President's repeated false claims about mail-in ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies. But in the days that have followed, Krebs has adopted a more forceful approach regularly posting on Twitter -- often with blaring red siren emojis -- fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by Trump, his allies and supporters around the country.While his pushback at the President's falsehoods had frustrated some at DHS, Krebs was responsible for a widely praised revamp of the department's cybersecurity efforts and increasing coordination with state and local governments, as the first director of CISA. He served as one of the most key federal national security officials that oversaw an election that by all accounts went very smoothly. Foreign adversaries were not able to affect any of the votes, CISA said, and it was ""the most secure election in American history,"" according to them and the wider group of public and private election officials. That was the statement for which the President decided to fire Krebs on Tuesday evening.News of his dismissal drew quick outrage from elected officials and election security experts. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine and co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in a statement, ""By firing Mr. Krebs for simply doing his job, President Trump is inflicting severe damage on all Americans -- who rely on CISA's defenses, even if they don't know it.""""If there's any silver lining in this unjust decision, it's this: I hope that President-elect Biden will recognize Chris's contributions, and consult with him as the Biden administration charts the future of this critically important agency,"" King said. In one notably forceful rebuke, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump's decision ""pathetic.""""Instead of rewarding this great service, President Trump is retaliating against Director Krebs and other officials who did their duty. It's pathetic, but sadly predictable that upholding and protecting our democratic processes would be cause for firing,"" Schiff said.Former DHS general counsel John Mitnick, also blasted Krebs' firing as ""outrageous but not surprising.""""@realDonaldTrump has made a habit of firing those who are highly competent, have integrity and courage, and stand up for the #RuleOfLaw. To @CISAKrebs: it was an honor to serve with you @DHSgov, and you should wear this as a badge of honor,"" he tweeted.Ben Hovland, a Trump appointee who is chairman of the US Election Assistance Commission, praised Krebs during an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront"" as a ""great director"" who ""showed a lot of leadership, particularly in the election space.""Asked about the President's false claims of massive voter fraud, Hovland explained, ""When you talk to election officials across the country, they're confident in the security of this election. They're confident in the outcome of the election -- that this was a fair election and that Americans made their voices heard, and we've got to respect the will of the people and the public servants that helped run this election and make this all possible.""Krebs' firing also prompted some notable pushback from Republicans. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, defended Krebs' work to CNN shortly after his dismissal.""I know Chris. I've worked well with him. I think he's a real professional,"" the Republican said.Asked if he wished Trump hadn't fired Krebs, Portman said: ""Yeah, I think he was very good.

He was quoting from a letter signed by 59 election specialists that also said that ""anyone asserting that a US election was 'rigged' is making an extraordinary claim"" and called them ""alarming assertions.""Firing Krebs, a US official previously told CNN, would ""cross a red line"" and set off alarm bells throughout the national security apparatus.Marcus Fowler, a former CIA officer who now works as the director of strategic threat at the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, described Krebs to CNN as ""a Dr. (Anthony) Fauci-like figure for election and cyber security, speaking truth to power about the security of the election based on the facts on the ground and the analysis of his subject matter experts.""""His forced departure at this critical time will absolutely degrade our national security, sends a horrible message and exposes vulnerability to our adversaries, and puts the credibility of the core democratic value of voting at risk of being undermined, manipulated, and hijacked,"" Fowler said.

A Tom and Jerry movie gets a hopeful plan for release in theaters next year,"Tom and Jerry have been trying to kill each other for 80 years -- and now, they'll continue that tradition in a new movie scheduled for release in theaters in 2021. The violently antagonistic cat and mouse will star in ""Tom and Jerry,"" a hybrid live-action and animated film that sees the two square off in an upscale New York hotel. Per the trailer, conniving mouse Jerry has taken up residence in the molding, and eager-to-please employee Chloë Grace Moretz is charged with evicting him. Tom arrives to help terrorize the mouse out of this house. But as anyone who's seen any iteration of ""Tom and Jerry"" knows, the cat rarely wins. In the trailer alone, Tom pinballs between two cars, is cartoonishly electrocuted, and is thrown in front of a bus by his tiny tormenter.  Michael Peña, Colin Jost and Ken Jeong co-star with the Hanna-Barbera characters. Cartoon violence ensues. Read MoreThe film is scheduled for a March theatrical release. Studios are tentatively scheduling films for wide theatrical releases in 2021 with hopes that coronavirus cases will subside and it'll be safe to gather in enclosed spaces with strangers again. Blockbusters like the James Bond flick ""No Time to Die"" and Marvel's ""Eternals"" were delayed for months from their initial release date, though many theaters haven't survived months-long closures brought on by the pandemic. Some studios are releasing films on streaming platforms, like Disney with its would-be blockbuster ""Mulan,"" or are screening them in theaters for a few weeks before they debut on demand.

Virginia Wesleyan University dean resigns after alleged Facebook post calling Biden voters 'anti-American' and 'anti-Christian',"Paul Ewell, the now former dean of the Virginia Wesleyan University Global Campus, resigned from both his deanship and his faculty post after allegedly writing a Facebook post on his since-deleted account that referred to voters for President-elect Joe Biden as ""anti-American"" and ""anti-Christian."" When asked for additional comment and whether he stood by his words in the post, Ewell told CNN in an email he ""apologized profusely"" and had ""nothing left to add."" Ewell did not acknowledge CNN's inquiry as to whether his resignation from VWU came in response to the post. Ewell's alleged post, a screenshot of which was originally reported in The Virginian-Pilot newspaper, implored any Facebook friends who may have voted for Biden or are Democrats to unfriend him on the social media platform.

Scott Atlas: Trump coronavirus adviser urges Michigan to 'rise up' against new Covid-19 measures,"White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas criticized Michigan's new Covid-19 restrictions in a tweet shortly after they were announced Sunday evening, urging people to ""rise up"" against the new public health measures.""The only way this stops is if people rise up,"" Atlas said. ""You get what you accept. #FreedomMatters #StepUp""States enact more Covid-19 rules as the US hits 11 million casesHis message -- which runs counter to the consensus of public health officials -- is likely to fuel new tension between the White House and Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom federal and state officials announced last month was the target of an alleged domestic terrorism kidnapping plot. Responding to Atlas' tweet Sunday evening, Whitmer told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""We know that the White House likes to single us out here in Michigan, me out in particular. I'm not going to be bullied into not following reputable scientists and medical professionals.""Instead, Whitmer said, she consults ""people that actually have studied and are well respected worldwide on these issues, not the -- not the individual that is doing the President's bidding on this one.""Read MoreMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed that message in a pair of tweets Sunday evening, casting Atlas' posting as, ""disappointing, irresponsible, and the reason why the United States finds itself in such desperate circumstances regarding COVID-19.""""I look forward to a new federal administration that works cooperatively with our state government to protect Michigan residents,"" Nessel, a Democrat, said. ""A patriot,"" she continued, ""is one who protects America from its enemies, both foreign and domestic.""""COVID-19 is the enemy, not each other. Stop pitting Americans against each other and start supporting policies proven to effectively fight the virus.""Whitmer announced in a news conference earlier Sunday that Michigan will begin a ""three-week pause targeting indoor social gatherings and other group activities"" to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. ""If everyone does their part, we will see a big benefit from it,"" she told Blitzer of the new measures. ""But we'll be assessing it every step of the way.""Throughout the pandemic, Whitmer has been the focus of extreme vitriol from far-right groups. The alleged scheme to kidnap her included plans to overthrow several state governments that the suspects ""believe are violating the US Constitution,"" according to a federal criminal complaint.Still, she joins a slate of officials who are tightening their restrictions as coronavirus cases continue to soar. The United States surpassed 11 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The latest milestone comes just six days after the US recorded 10 million cases.It was the fastest the US has added one million new cases since the pandemic began.Unlike the government medical experts who advised Trump in the early months of the pandemic, Atlas has adopted a public stance on the virus much closer to the President's -- including decrying the idea that schools cannot reopen this fall as ""hysteria"" and pushing for the resumption of college sports.""He's working with us and will be working with us on the coronavirus,"" Trump said in August.

Space travel: Going to space is a real pain in the back,"A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study. In 1994, astronaut Mark Lee had his height measured by fellow astronaut Jerry Linenger as part of a study on back pain.Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission. Mars mission astronauts could experience brain damage, study saysThings don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc. ""It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,"" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. ""So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.""Like being in a body castRead MoreMuch attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling. Hope, Courage and Unity: The story behind the young cancer patients who painted space suitsWhat they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury. In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months. Our bodies in space: Zero gravity weighs heavy on your healthMRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. ""Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,"" Chang explained.Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.Yoga in space?Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine. Astronauts ask Congress to take care of their healthIn addition to the ""fetal tuck"" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done. ""A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit."" Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station. Scott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007.Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity. Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.""When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,"" he said. ""Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.""All of them are committed to furthering space knowledge and making incremental steps forward in any way they can for the next crew.""",2016-10-26T10:05:59Z,http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/health/astronaut-back-pain-spine-health-space/index.html,2020-11-16 11:08:32.190607,CNN,technology,0
"Maryland CEO paid former fencing coach $1.5 million in bribes to get his sons accepted to Harvard, feds say","A Maryland businessman paid Harvard University's former fencing coach at least $1.5 million in bribes, including payments for a car and a house in the suburbs, to get his sons admitted to the Ivy League school, federal prosecutors said in a criminal complaint released Monday.Jie ""Jack"" Zhao, 61, and Peter Brand, 67, were arrested Monday and charged with conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery for the alleged agreement, the US Attorney's Office in the District of Massachusetts said.Zhao, of Potomac, Maryland, is the CEO of telecom company iTalk Global Communications. He was scheduled to appear Monday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland.Brand was Harvard's men's and women's fencing coach from 1999 until last year, when he was fired by the university following an investigation spurred by reporting from The Boston Globe on his suspiciously expensive house sale. He will appear in federal court in Boston on Monday afternoon.Attorney Douglas Brooks, who represents Brand, told CNN his client ""did nothing wrong."" When Brand was fired in 2019, Brooks also said Brand had done nothing wrong.Read More""The students were academic and fencing stars. Coach Brand did nothing wrong in connection with their admission to Harvard. He looks forward to the truth coming out in court,"" Brooks said in an emailed statement to CNN Monday night.The arrests are just the latest salvo in the sprawling college admissions scam, first revealed in March 2019, in which rich parents of college applicants used their wealth to cheat on standardized tests, bribe sports coaches and lie about the payments.Harvard head fencing coach accused of selling his home to the family of a prospective student has been fired""This case is part of our long-standing effort to expose and deter corruption in college admissions,"" said US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling. ""Millions of teenagers strive for college admission every year. We will do our part to make that playing field as level as we possibly can.""An attorney for Zhao denied the charges in an email on Monday.""Jack Zhao's children were academic stars in high school and internationally competitive fencers who obtained admission to Harvard on their own merit,"" attorney Bill Weinreb said in a statement. ""Both of them fenced for Harvard at the Division One level throughout their college careers.  Mr. Zhao adamantly denies these charges and will vigorously contest them in court.""The conspiracy charge comes with a possible sentence of up to five years in prison. Other parents who were charged with similar counts and pleaded guilty, such as actress Lori Loughlin, have generally been sentenced to several months in prison.How the scheme allegedly workedCollege coaches do not explicitly decide who gets accepted into the university, but their recommendations to the admissions office about certain recruited athletes carry powerful influence.The complaint alleges Zhao made a series of payments totaling $1.5 million to Brand in exchange for the coach recruiting Zhao's two sons to the fencing team, thereby facilitating their acceptance to the prestigious university.""Jack doesn't need to take me anywhere and his boys don't have to be great fencers,"" Brand allegedly told a co-conspirator in May 2012, according to the complaint. ""All I need is a good incentive to recruit them[.] You can tell him that[.]""Cheat. Bribe. Lie. Here's how the college admissions scam allegedly workedIn February 2013, Zhao made a purported donation of $1 million to a fencing charity operated by a co-conspirator, prosecutors say. Zhao's older son was admitted to Harvard as a fencing recruit in December 2013 and matriculated to the university in the fall of 2014, and shortly afterward, the conspirator's fencing charity paid $100,000 to Brand's charitable foundation, prosecutors say.The older son graduated in 2018, according to The Boston Globe. As Brand recruited Zhao's younger son, the businessman made a series of payments to Brand or for his personal benefit, prosecutors say. Zhao allegedly paid for Brand's car, made college tuition payments for Brand's son, paid the mortgage on Brand's house in Needham, Massachusetts, and then bought the house for well above market value, prosecutors say.The payments allowed Brand to buy a more expensive residence in nearby Cambridge that Zhao then paid to renovate, the complaint states. Zhao's younger son began attending Harvard in 2017, and the complaint alleges Brand did not tell the university about the payments when recruiting the sons.The Needham house payment drew particular attention from Harvard and federal investigators. Brand sold the home to Zhao for $989,500, according to the deed, almost twice what a tax document said it was worth. Zhao then sold the Needham property about 17 months later at a loss of over $300,000.Following the sale of his Needham home, Brand purchased a condominium in Cambridge. Documents obtained by CNN show the Cambridge property was originally listed for $989,000 -- just $500 less than what Zhao paid the Needham home. Brand bought the Cambridge condo for about $300,000 over the asking price.CNN's Augusta Anthony contributed to this report.",2020-11-16T17:45:51Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/us/college-admissions-scam-harvard/index.html,2020-11-17 10:30:24.301399,CNN,world,0

Hurricane Iota expected to hit Central America as an 'extremely dangerous' Category 4 storm,"Hurricane Iota has rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane as it approaches Central America, where it's expected to make landfall as an ""extremely dangerous"" Category 4 storm Monday night.Iota has maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and is forecast to have a life-threatening storm surge of 10 to 15 feet along with rainfall of 1 to 2 feet, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center.The storm is moving west at about 10 mph and is about 45 miles off the coast of Isla de Providencia, Colombia. Iota is threatening many hard-hit areas of Central America, where people are still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Eta.

A hurricane warning is in effect for Providencia, the coast of Nicaragua from the Honduras/Nicaragua border to Sandy Bay Sirpi, as well as the coast of Honduras from Punta Patuca to the Nicaragua border, according to NHC. The storm is forecast to pass near or over Providencia Island Monday bringing hurricane conditions as it takes aim at the Nicaraguan and Honduran coasts.Read MoreNavy members help evacuate people from the Karata and Wawa Bar communities ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Iota in Bilwi, Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua Sunday.Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are also in effect for surrounding areas.

Lindsey Graham just crossed another line in defending Trump,"Fresh off a surprisingly pedestrian election win on November 3, Lindsey Graham has decided to take on a new role: The most aggressive enforcer of the idea that President Donald Trump maybe -- just maybe! -- didn't lose the 2020 election.In recent days, the South Carolina Republican has reached out to election officials in at least three states -- Georgia, Arizona and Nevada -- to inquire about the process by which, among other things, signatures are verified on mail-in ballots.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told CNN that Graham had called him to urge the removal of ballots amid the ongoing hand recount in the state. ""I got the sense it implied that then you could throw those out for any, if you look at the counties with the highest frequent error of signatures,"" Raffensperger told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday night. ""So that's the impression that I got.""Graham told CNN that Raffensperger's allegations was ""ridiculous."" But a staffer for the Georgia secretary of state affirmed Raffensperger's version of events to CNN on Tuesday. ""What I heard was basically discussions about absentee ballots and if a potentially ... if there was a percentage of signatures that weren't really, truly matching, is there some point we could get to, we could say somebody went to a courtroom could say, 'Well, let's throw (out) all these ballots because we have no way of knowing because the ballots are separated,' "" said Georgia election implementation manager Gabriel Sterling.Read More

Graham, even as he was defending his call to Raffensperger, revealed to reporters that he had also reached out to election officials in two other states where the vote count between Trump and President-elect Joe Biden was quite close -- and where the President has insisted, with zero proof, that there were shenanigans involved in the ballot counting. That claim, however, was almost immediately disputed by Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, who said she had not spoken to Graham (or any other member of Congress) about the vote count in the state. Graham told reporters he was not sure who he had talked to in Nevada (uh, OK) and that he had spoken with Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in Arizona.Of course, all of this back-and-forth over who Graham called and what, specifically, he said misses this larger point: Why in the hell has Lindsey Graham self-deputized himself to play this role for Trump? Graham has said he did not make these calls at Trump's behest.After all, it's a little odd for the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to be placing personal calls into states that had tight vote counts in search of, uh, information about their voting processes. It's not too much to suggest that such calls might be regarded by the people on the other end of the line as a bit of intimidation. Imagine you are an elections official in Nevada -- I'd name names but Graham can't remember who he talked to! -- and a call comes in from Graham, one of Trump's most loyal and high profile allies. Sort of unexpected! And definitely a little nerve-wracking!Aside the possibility of intimidation of election officials, there's just how the whole thing looks. Which is, um, not good. Because why is a sitting US senator not from Georgia, Arizona or Nevada suddenly so interested in the minutiae of how a state conducts its own elections? And why did Graham just happen to express so much interest in these three states that just happened to be swing states in the 2020 election? (Sidebar: There are no consequences in politics. None.)So -- even for Graham, who has comfortably settled into his role as top Trump toady over the President's first term -- this feels like a new line that he has crossed. Which is odd. Because in 64 days, Donald Trump won't be president anymore. But Graham will still be in the Senate -- and forced to look his colleagues in the eye and explain why he did what he did over the last four years.",2020-11-17T19:57:11Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/lindsey-graham-2020-election-georgia-trump/index.html,2020-11-18 08:54:44.047794,CNN,politics,0

"'Dueling dinosaurs' fossils show Triceratops, T. rex, may have died after a battle","It may have been a battle for the ages in ancient Montana. About 67 million years ago, two iconic dinosaurs, a Triceratops horridus and a Tyrannosaurus rex, died and were quickly buried together side by side in a single grave. And both of them bear battle scars. It's the kind of showdown scientists have speculated about for years, but it has only ever appeared in ""Jurassic Park"" games -- until now.The impressively complete skeletons of these ""dueling dinosaurs"" will go on display and be studied at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in 2022, the museum announced Tuesday. The museum is located in downtown Raleigh.New fossil discovery suggests dinosaurs traveled across oceansThe fossil of the Triceratops was first discovered 2006 as it eroded out of sedimentary rock from the Hell Creek Formation. This rock formation, which dates to 65.5 million years ago, was named for Hell Creek near Jordan, Montana. The treasure trove of fossils from the end of the Cretaceous Period stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.The remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex were also found slightly overlapping with the Triceratops. Both were extracted from the rock formation, encased in plaster and safely stored until they could be studied. Read MoreThey are some of the most complete dinosaur skeletons ever found. What's more, the researchers believe the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton is the only 100% complete T. rex fossil.The T. rex portion of the double fossil discovery shows what appears to be a juvenile dinosaur.Both skeletons are also articulated, meaning all of the bones have been preserved in their proper order. It's rare to find one articulated fossil, and this discovery includes two. An ancient cold caseWhile the fossils are still trapped in sedimentary stone, what's visible tells an intriguing story.So far, an analysis of the Triceratops fossil has revealed actual skin impressions on its signature frill and hips. Teeth from the tyrannosaur are embedded in its spine. But the Triceratops' arms aren't visible. Researchers aren't sure if they're simply locked in the stone beneath its body or if they were scavenged by other dinosaurs before the Triceratops was buried. The fossils show skin impressions.They also want to find out if the contents of its stomach were preserved. If so, they could learn about its last meal. The Tyrannosaurus rex had most of its teeth broken; it also bears a broken finger and its skull is cracked. Researchers want to uncover if all of this damage was sustained during a possible battle with the Triceratops, or if these were post-mortem injuries.A 12-year-old found a 69 million-year-old dinosaur fossil while hiking with his dadThe Tyrannoraurus rex fossil also bears a skin impression on its foot, which researchers said is remarkably similar to that of a modern emu. The museum is building a new lab, the SECU DinoLab, to house the fossils when they go on display in 2022. It will also be a hub for scientists studying the fossils. The exhibit is expected to be on public display for five years.The T. rex skull shows evidence of broken teeth.Some of the other questions researchers want to answer about the fossils include determining if molecules are preserved in the skin impressions and if the tyrannosaur fossil shows evidence of feathers. Scientists would also like to identify if it was an adolescent Tyrannosaurus rex and uncover more details of the Triceratops' frill. And, of course, they want to know how the dinosaurs died and if they were actually locked in a dueling showdown beforehand. How a toothless, parrot-like dinosaur thrived 69 million years agoBecause the fossils are still entombed in sediment, their body outlines and impressions of skin and soft tissue remain. These details are often lost when fossils are entirely excavated in the field. ""We have not yet studied this specimen; it is a scientific frontier. The preservation is phenomenal, and we plan to use every technological innovation available to reveal new information on the biology of T. rex and Triceratops. This fossil will forever change our view of the world's two favorite dinosaurs,"" said Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and associate research professor at North Carolina State University, in a statement. The T. rex had sharp, crescent-shaped talons.""The way we have designed the entire experience — inviting the public to follow the scientific discoveries in real time and participate in the research — will set a new standard for museums.""Donating dinosaursThe popular dinosaur pair was donated to the museum by the Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences on Tuesday.  The nonprofit organization acquired the fossils using private funds provided by support from a wealth of foundations. Swallowed whole: A fossilized sea creature's insides reveal a reptile nearly the same size""It is an immeasurable honor to welcome these specimens as they take up permanent residence here at the Museum,"" said Jason Barron, chair of the Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. ""Dueling Dinosaurs is a singular find; we are incredibly grateful to our supporters for making this a reality and allowing our visitors -- in-person and virtual alike -- to experience this journey with us.""The exhibit will also further the museum's paleontology education and research programs.A dinosaur's last meal: A 110 million-year-old dinosaur's stomach contents are revealed""The Museum is thrilled to have the unique opportunity to house and research one of the most important paleontological discoveries of our time,"" said Eric Dorfman, director and CEO of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a statement. ""Not only are we able to uncover unknown details of these animals' anatomy and behavior, but our new dedicated facility and educational programs will allow us to engage with audiences locally, across North Carolina, and worldwide.""The SECU DinoLab will provide visitors with the chance to observe researchers as they study the fossils and also talk with the paleontology team. And for those at home, the lab will share research updates and live videos to learn more about their findings in real time.",2020-11-17T20:52:17Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/world/dueling-dinosaurs-triceratops-t-rex-scn-trnd/index.html,2020-11-18 09:00:40.568608,CNN,technology,0

'The Liberator' review: Netflix's animated experiment tells a flat World War II tale,"""The Liberator"" qualifies as an interesting experiment, and not much more -- using digital animation over actual footage (an evolution of the process once known as rotoscoping) to create a highly stylized look, but then telling a World War II story in a stiff, uninspired way.Those interested in the process should surely want to take a look at this Netflix miniseries, which was actually developed for the History channel. That said, it's hard to suggest sticking around for this fact-based story of a one much-decorated infantry unit's march across Europe, a project whose dialogue and presentation suffer from a lifelessness only enhanced by the washed-out nature of the animation.Premiering on Veteran's Day, the series was created by Jeb Stuart (""Die Hard""), based on the book ""The Liberator: One World II Soldier's 500-Day Odyssey,"" which focuses on army officer Felix Sparks and his Oklahoma unit that consisted largely of Native Americans and Mexican-Americans. Their journey began in Italy and concludes with the horror of the Dachau concentration camp.The technology at work, with the unwieldy name Trioscope Enhanced Hybrid Animation, establishes a comic-book-like feel. While the characters look real, if a little fuzzy, the backgrounds can be rendered in a way that creates animated tanks and explosions, without needing to construct sets or find locations.The visuals, however, actually work against becoming wholly engaged in the drama, blurring the distinctions of the characters, who, beyond Sparks (played by ""Damien"" star Bradley James), are pretty thinly drawn (pun intended) to begin with.Read MoreRotoscoping was championed by animator Ralph Bakshi on movies like ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Fire and Ice,"" and this certainly resembles a next-generation application of the process, which creates interesting possibilities going forward.For starters, it would seem to be a way to produce certain kinds of action movies more economically -- which, as Variety reported, was the motivation for transforming what would have been an eight-part live-action version of the story into its current four-part form.Like any technical gimmick, though, a movie or TV show is only as good as the writing and characters. It's there where ""The Liberator"" fails to come alive, coming across as a pale version of old black-and-white World War II movies, in a way that feels -- as is so easy to do when the emphasis is on gee-whiz technological tools -- like focusing on the wrapping and bow instead of the gift within them.""The Liberator"" premieres Nov. 11 on Netflix.",2020-11-11T21:39:14Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/entertainment/the-liberator-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:17:28.675863,CNN,entertainment,0

The federal officials working for the group are on leave from their federal government jobs, according to Braynard.""None of them are here because they work in the Trump administration.

"Fox News has never seen competition like Newsmax
","Trump supporters are seeking alternatives to Fox News after President Donald Trump criticized the network that, like mainstream media networks, called the presidential race for Joe Biden.Newsmax and One America News — which falsely claim Trump won the 2020 election —  are two of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump and his supporters' ire. The channels' ratings have surged in recent days.Although Biden won the election — a fact Trump acknowledged Sunday — Greg Kelly, the highest-rated host on Newsmax, claims that Trump will prevail and that he will be president for another four years. The network has gone from about 100,000 viewers a day on a good day to about one million viewers per night for Kelly's show. ""Fox has never seen competition like this,"" CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday. ""There is demand for a fictional universe.... Reliable news sources are mostly moving on to cover President-elect Biden. There is an entire constellation of websites and talk shows that are in denial just like Trump.""Helping boost the Fox News rivals' ratings, Trump is telling his Twitter followers to try Newsmax and One America News. In a Sunday tweet, Trump criticized Fox and said, ""Try @OANN & @newsmax, among others!""Read MoreHowever, this weekend, Trump continued to promote Fox News and the hosts he admires, including Jesse Watters, Jeanine Ferris Pirro and Sean Hannity, all of whom have sown doubt about the election results. He also tweeted that people should watch his lawyer Rudy Giuliani's Fox appearances.TV anchors are getting pressured by viewers in ways that never happened in the 80s or 90s, Julie Roginsky, former Fox News contributor and Democratic strategist, noted on ""Reliable Sources.""""That has a tremendous influence on the information that you receive,"" she said.Fox has dominated right-wing TV for more than a decade, but the network's monopoly control is starting to break apart.

""They're literally giving a drug to their viewers.""Right-wing media viewers are searching for people to tell them what they want to hear, said former ABC News White House correspondent Sam Donaldson.""It doesn't have to be a Hannity,"" he said.

Stanford distances itself from Dr. Scott Atlas after he urges resistance to public health measures,"Stanford University on Monday evening distanced itself from White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at the school's Hoover Institution, after he urged Michigan residents to ""rise up"" against new public health measures.""Stanford's position on managing the pandemic in our community is clear. We support using masks, social distancing, and conducting surveillance and diagnostic testing. We also believe in the importance of strictly following the guidance of local and state health authorities,"" the university said in a tweet. ""Dr. Atlas has expressed views that are inconsistent with the university's approach in response to the pandemic.

Gretchen Whitmer, whom federal and state officials announced last month was the target of an alleged domestic terrorism kidnapping plot.Responding to Atlas' tweet Sunday evening, Whitmer told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, ""We know that the White House likes to single us out here in Michigan, me out in particular. I'm not going to be bullied into not following reputable scientists and medical professionals.""Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Atlas -- who removed a reference to the Hoover Institution in his Twitter handle -- said he wasn't trying to ""threaten or incite violence"" but rather is just ""not very good at Twitter.""Atlas said the tweet was in response to ""literally thousands of emails I get from people all over the country, begging me to figure out how to end the lockdowns,"" including from family members of people who have died by suicide amid restrictions.""And so what I meant, and I'm sorry I'm not very articulate on Twitter, is that basically if you want to change things you have to have your voices heard,"" he explained. ""I didn't mean anything more than that.""Unlike the government medical experts who advised President Donald Trump in the early months of the pandemic, Atlas has adopted a public stance on the virus much closer to the President's -- including decrying the idea that schools cannot reopen this fall as ""hysteria"" and pushing for the resumption of college sports.

Hurricane Iota brings catastrophic winds and likely life-threatening flooding just miles from where Eta made landfall,"Hurricane Iota has barreled into a Central America still recovering from Eta, and is bringing with it the possibility of ""life-threatening"" flooding, catastrophic winds and mudslides.Swells from the storm will be felt from Central America to the Yucatán Peninsula, as far east as Jamaica and as far south as Colombia, but its landfall was just 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta struck, potentially leaving the region scarred for generations. The storm reached Category 5 strength, but made landfall near the town of Haulover, Nicaragua, at 10:40 p.m. EST as a Category 4, with maximum sustained winds near 155 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It has since weakened to winds near 130 mph.Those in the area have begun to withstand heavy rainfall from the storm, with Honduras and Nicaragua expecting maximum totals of 30 inches of rain through Thursday, while El Salvador to Panama can expect 6 to 10, with isolated maximums of 15 inches. River and flash flooding may soon follow along with dangerous storm surge that is likely to bring water levels up by as much as 10 to 15 feet, the National Hurricane Center said in a 1 a.m. alert.The predicted storm surge along the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras will be accompanied by ""large and destructive waves,"" along with swells that cause ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,"" according to the advisory.Read MoreHurricane warnings are in effect for the coast of Nicaragua from its border with Honduras to Sandy Bay Sirpi, as well as the coast of northeastern Honduras, the NHC said.

'The Crown' creator defends 'made up' scenes in the hit Netflix show,"Peter Morgan, the creator of ""The Crown,"" has defended including imagined scenes in the latest series of the hit Netflix show.Season four, which is based on real-life events but not entirely factual, premiered on Netflix on Sunday with a range of new characters, including Princess Diana and then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher.In the first episode of the new series, Lord Louis Mountbatten, played by Charles Dance, confronts his great-nephew, Prince Charles, for being romantically involved with Camilla, who was married to Andrew Parker Bowles at the time. In the series, Mountbatten is also shown to write a letter accusing Charles, portrayed by Josh O'Connor, of contemplating such ""ruin and disappointment"" to himself and his family, and orders him to instead marry ""some sweet and innocent well-tempered girl with no past.""Actor Charles Dance portraying Lord Mountbatten in season 4 of ""The Crown.""In the show, Charles receives the correspondence after learning that Mountbatten has been assassinated by the IRA -- but some critics insist there is no evidence that such a letter was ever written.

It's time you got married and it's time you provided an heir,'""  Morgan said. 'The Crown' Season 4: Recreating more unforgettable looks from royal history  ""I think everything that's in the letter that Mountbatten writes to Charles is what I really believe -- you know, based on everything I've read and people I've spoken to, that that represents his view.""We will never know if it was put into a letter, and we will never know if Charles got that letter before or after Mountbatten's death but in this particular drama, this is how I decided to deal with it,"" he added.Critics of the show have argued that the latest series includes a raft of falsehoods. ""People actually do believe it because it is well filmed, lavishly produced, well acted with good actors. You can't just dismiss it as tabloid rubbish,"" Hugo Vickers, historian and author of ""The Crown Dissected,"" told CNN. ""In this particular series, every member of the royal family, in my view, comes out of it badly, except the Princess of Wales,"" he said.

Russian gamers race to prevent nuclear 'war',"""Attention! Attention!"" blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. ""The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.""Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.Their quest -- the latest craze in Moscow -- is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general. It's complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.   Read MoreA mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching ""I'm worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,"" said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.  ""I know that normal people all over the world don't want any war,"" he added. A nation preparing for conflictBut Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia's old Cold War rival. Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.   Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.  Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction -- or MAD -- still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War. Lithuania issues manual on what to do if Russia invadesBut with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real. ""I don't think nuclear war is likely,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a prominent foreign policy journal.""But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don't have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,"" he told CNN. Kremlin playing up fearsIt is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.  In its flagship current affairs show, Russia's top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev -- dubbed the Kremlin's propagandist-in-chief by critics -- recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.  ""Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,"" he declared.Russia, US move past Cold War to unpredictable conflictThe Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal. The Satan 2, as it's known, will be the world's most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia's place as a top nuclear power. It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow. ""I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,"" said  Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer. ""But it sounds ridiculous to me and I'm totally sure that war is impossible,"" she adds. The quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert warBack in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch.  The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack. Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too.

Why some dinosaurs had such long necks ,"Sauropods were the largest animals to ever walk the Earth. These long-necked dinosaurs could grow the length of three school buses and were so heavy the ground must have shaken as they walked. This family of dinosaurs, however, wasn't always so gigantic. In the first 50 million years of their evolutionary history, sauropods were much more diverse. While some were quite large, at about 10 meters in length, the family also included more lightly built animals that were no larger than a goat. What's more, some sauropods walked on two legs while others used four.So how did these dinos with the signature long neck get so big? New fossil discovery suggests dinosaurs traveled across oceansFossil finds from Patagonia in South America have shed new light on this mystery. A team of paleontologists has discovered one of the earliest known large sauropods, and plant fossils in the rock layers surrounding the dinosaur fossil provide evidence of the climate and ecosystem in which the newly identified species of dinosaur lived. The scientists named it Bagualia alba after Bagual Canyon, where the dinosaur fossil was found, and alba, which means ""dawn"" in Spanish, for its early age. Read MoreThe sauropod's huge size was likely a response to a shift in climate 180 million years ago during the early Jurassic period, the new research has suggested. This evolutionary transformation was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere that resulted in a change of flora that formed the plant-eating sauropod diet. Inside a dinosaur egg, this baby wasn't what researchers expected""There (were) lava flows extended for over a million square miles. This is way larger than anything we have witnessed in human times. Large amounts of CO2 and methane were released to the atmosphere and there is a well studied warming of the climate at a global scale,"" Diego Pol, principal researcher at the Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio in Argentina told CNN via email. ""But we did not know what was the effect of this global crisis in the terrestrial ecosystems. Our lack of knowledge was because sediments with dinosaurs and plants of that particular age are very uncommon.""The shift in diet meant that many sauropod groups disappeared and only one lineage survived -- the big sauropods known as eusauropods. Bagualia alba would likely have been 10 tons -- around the size of two African elephants -- but later sauropods were up to 40 meters in length and weighed 70 tons. The dinosaur's long neck would have enabled it to reach tall conifer trees and stay in one spot while it ate, since moving such a huge body expended a lot of energy. Change in vegetationIn particular, it was the change in vegetation in a harsher climate that led to the extinction of most sauropods. Tall conifer trees came to dominate the warmer, more arid environment. These trees supplanted the lush vegetation of the humid environment that preceded the volcanic event. Fossils from this environment show ferns with fronds larger than 6 feet, Pol said.""The only ones that survived this crisis were eusauropods. They have long been regarded as bulk feeders, with teeth and jaws that were able to cut and swallow all kinds of plants including conifers. Dinosaur diagnosed with bone cancer that afflicts humans today""Moreover we found that the enamel of the teeth of Bagualia was about 7 times thicker than those of the other herbivores that went extinct. This allowed them to feed on the tough coriaceous leaves of conifers,"" said Pol, referring to the new species of dinosaur.In fact, the large digestive chambers needed to cope with this kind of vegetation were probably one reason why these animals reached these huge sizes.The dinosaur's tooth had thick enamel to enable the animal to feed on tough conifer leaves. And the long necks? They would have enabled them to reach the tall conifers and allowed them to access different plants without moving their huge bodies, Pol said.""Their large bodies required them to eat a large amount of food to meet their energetic requirements. But if you are big and heavy and have to move a lot to acquire the food you need, you may spend quite a lot of energy (and then require even more food),"" he said. Giant animals also produce a lot of body heat, and other studies have suggested that their long neck could dissipate body heat -- a bit like the big ears of modern elephants, Pol explained. The research was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Tuesday.",2020-11-18T00:01:06Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/americas/dinosaur-sauropods-long-necks-scn/index.html,2020-11-18 09:09:16.550160,CNN,world,0
Father sues the city of Fort Worth and former police officer for shooting death of Atatiana Jefferson,"The family of Atatiana Jefferson, who was fatally shot through the window of her home, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Fort Worth and Aaron Dean, the former Fort Worth police officer who shot her.According to an amended complaint filed November 17 in the Northern District of Texas, the conduct of Aaron Dean during ""the course and scope of employment caused the untimely death of Atatiana Carr a/k/a Atatiana Jefferson.""Dean, 34, resigned from the force and was charged with murder, the charge on which he was indicted in December 2019. When asked for comment, Aaron Dean's criminal case attorney told CNN, ""We are currently under a gag rule in the criminal case, so I have no comment.""As a nation cries for justice in police killings, Atatiana Jefferson's siblings demand she not be forgottenJefferson, 28, was playing video games with her nephew around 2 a.m. on October 12, 2019, when Aaron Dean and another officer arrived at her home.Read MoreA concerned neighbor had called the nonemergency police number after noticing the home's exterior doors were open at that late hour. As officers walked around the house in the dark, Jefferson heard a noise in the backyard, pulled out a gun from her purse, and pointed it at the window, police said.Dean yelled, ""Put your hands up!

Western Sahara's Polisario Front leader declares end of ceasefire with Morocco,"The leader of the Western Sahara's independence movement has vowed to end a 29-year-old ceasefire with Morocco, citing recent Moroccan border operations as a provocation.Brahim Ghali, leader of the independentist Polisario Front, announced the group will no longer abide by the commitment of the decades-long truce in the area, said Sahara Press Service, the group's news agency, on Saturday. Morocco, which says it continues to support the ceasefire, announced last week that it would resume military operations in the El Guergarat crossing, a buffer zone between the territory claimed by the state of Morocco and the self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. By launching the operation, Morocco ""seriously undermined not only the ceasefire and related military agreements but also any chances of achieving a peaceful and lasting solution to the decolonization question of the Western Sahara,"" Ghali said in a letter to the UN. The Western Sahara is a long-disputed territory to the southwest of Morocco controlled mostly by the Moroccan state, which occupies about 75% of the territory, according to the CIA World Factbook. Morocco and the Polisario Front fought over the territory after Spain gave up the rule in 1976 and Mauritania withdrew their claim of control in 1979. After negotiating a truce in 1991, the UN has recognized the area as ""non-self-governing territory.""Read MoreMorocco's Foreign Ministry has said its border operation was intended to ""consolidate the ceasefire"" in  response to Polisario Front allegedly blocking the movement of people and goods and harassing UN troops at the crossing.""Morocco remains firmly attached to the preservation of the ceasefire, noting that the operation carried out by the Royal Armed Forces aims precisely to consolidate the ceasefire by preventing the recurrence of such serious and inadmissible acts that violate the military agreement and threaten regional security and stability,"" the ministry said.The UN however has denied that their troops were harassed. ""MINURSO has engaged peacefully at Guergerat with both the demonstrators supported by the Polisario Front and with the Morocco army with the aim of reducing tensions, since the beginning of the demonstrations on 21 October,"" UN spokesperson Nick Birnback said in a statement.The Sahara Press Service said on Saturday that the Polisario Front also launched attacks against the Royal Moroccan Army in the Western Sahara, ""causing loss of lives and equipments and disrupting its military plans."" The Moroccan government has not yet commented on these claims.The UN, which maintains a peacekeeping mission in the Western Sahara, MINURSO, said it made attempts to convince all parties to avoid an escalation of hostilities and preserve the ceasefire but was unsuccessful. ""The Secretary-General remains committed to doing his utmost to avoid the collapse of the ceasefire that has been in place since 6 September 1991 and he is determined to do everything possible to remove all obstacles to the resumption of the political process,"" Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General said in a statement. Over the years, more than 100,000 people from the area have become refugees due to the conflict, according to a Global Security report.",2020-11-15T23:33:27Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/world/polisario-front-morocco-western-sahara-ceasefire-intl/index.html,2020-11-16 11:00:42.532793,CNN,world,0

"At least 1,000 people detained in Belarus in a single day following protester's death","At least 1,000 people were detained across Belarus on Sunday, according to local human rights watchdog Viasna, amid mass demonstrations against longstanding leader Alexander Lukashenko, which were prompted by the results of an August election that protesters say was rigged. It is the largest number of detentions reported in a single day since the protests began. The total number of people detained since August is believed to be over 25,000, according to Viasna. Sunday marked the fourteenth week in a row that protesters have taken to the streets demanding the resignation of Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for 26 years. The mass detentions followed the death of Roman Bondarenko, a 31-year-old anti-government protester, who died in a hospital in Minsk on Thursday after he was severely beaten by security forces, according to demonstrators and his family members. Protesters chanted and carried signs with the words ""I'm going out,"" which were Bondarenko's last known words before he died. He was beaten at Minsk's ""square of change,"" which was the final point for all Minsk protesters on Sunday. Bondarenko was a painter, who lived in Minsk and had served in the military. Read MoreBelarus opposition supporters wearing face masks attend a rally to protest against the Belarus presidential election results in Minsk, on November 15.His sister, Volga Kucharenka, said in a video on Thursday that Bondarenko was beaten at the central police department, or on the way to this department. She said he was taken from Minsk's central police department to the hospital on Wednesday night after suffering severe injuries. He died the next day at around 8pm local time, she said. ""Tonight I have found out that my brother has died in the hospital after being the whole day in the intensive care room,"" Kucharenka said in the video Thursday while barely containing her tears. ""Roman did not provoke the fight, I know for sure, I know from eyewitnesses. All bad had happened later... I made this video to let people know what is going on. My brother was a calm and positive guy, he always avoided conflicts.""During Sunday's protests in Minsk, police wielded clubs and used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds. Video shows police violently beating protesters at a supermarket. Other videos show police detaining people and taking them away in police vehicles. Detentions have also occurred in the cities of Navahrudak, Babruisk, Vitsebsk, Homel and Svetlahorsk, according to Viasna. At least 23 journalists have been detained across the country, the Belarussian Association of Journalists said in a statement Sunday. ""Police detained journalists covering the protests in Minsk, Vitebsk, Hrodna and Pinsk. We know of 23 detentions,"" the Belarussian Association of Journalists said in the statement. Former presidential candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who now lives outside Belarus, called Bondarenko a hero of the protest who was killed ""by accomplices of the regime,"" and urged Belarusians to continue to protest peacefully. ""He was an innocent victim of an inhumane system that considers people's lives to be the cost of power,"" Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. ""We all understand that any peaceful person could have ended up in his place."" ""Like millions of Belarusians, I sympathize with Roman's family. We will not forgive this murder. We will write the name of Roman in the history of the new Belarus as the name of a hero.""Law enforcement officers gather to disperse opposition supporters during a rally to protest against the Belarus presidential election results in Minsk, on November 15.Responding to Bandarenko's death, Amnesty International's Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Marie Struthers, said authorities in Belarus ""must immediately launch a prompt, thorough, impartial and independent investigation.""""There is little if any doubt that he was beaten by security force officers, like hundreds of other peaceful protesters that have been attacked simply for raising their voices,"" Struthers said. ""Instead of taking him to hospital, police arrested him and took him into custody.""""It is time to put an end to this reign of terror and unmask all those responsible for committing these crimes.""On Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Belarusian authorities to release the political prisoners they have detained ""for exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms by peacefully participating in protests, calling for free and fair elections, and advocating for a national dialogue to end the ongoing crisis.""""These political prisoners have been subject to harsh and life-threatening detention conditions, including credible reports of torture,"" Pompeo said. ""They are among the thousands of individuals who have been subjected to unjust detentions since the start of the violent crackdown.""""The United States stands with those who remain detained and unaccounted for, those who have been killed, and those who continue to peacefully assert their right to choose their leaders in free and fair elections,"" he said.",2020-11-16T04:15:53Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/europe/belarus-protests-death-election-intl/index.html,2020-11-16 10:59:37.862553,CNN,world,0

7 ways to snack better during the pandemic,"Chips, cookies, munchies: There is so much snacking going on.It's no shock that many of us reach for cookies, candy, chips and other indulgences during stressful times, whether it's due to the pandemic, the resulting economic downtown or a divisive US election. Snack food consumption, including both sweet and savory snacks, increased by 8% during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to consumer research company NPD Group's Snack Food Behaviors in Challenging Times study.That's much more than during the Great Recession, between 2008 and 2010, where snack foods increased by 1%, or 4.8 billion eatings. (An ""eating"" is defined as one occasion that involves eating a meal or a snack.)  ""I think the increase in snacking was so pronounced now versus the last recession because this downturn came upon us so suddenly,"" said Darren Seifer, food industry analyst at The NPD Group, via email.Craving sugar during a pandemic? Here's how to tame your sweet toothRead More""At the beginning of the lockdowns, consumers had to make decisions on how to feed their families in a matter of weeks, while the last recession took months to fully take its grip,"" Seifer said. ""Consumers quickly stocked up on snacks and indulgent foods for their shelf lives while others were stress eating."" ""I see the rise in snack consumption as the result of lockdown boredom and pandemic and election anxiety,"" said Marion Nestle, New York University's Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health.But excess snacking translates to excess calories. ""The more snacks, the more calories they provide,"" Nestle said. ""More calories means more pounds unless snackers compensate by eating less at meals."" Reaching for comfort foods is soothing and can be a way to cope with life's uncertainties and challenges. But if you feel your snacking has become an unhealthy habit, here are seven strategies to snack better.Try the hunger meterSalted date caramel truffles may satisfy your sweet tooth.1. Take a pause.  Before you reach for a snack, it's a good idea to stop and think about what will satisfy you. Is it really a handful of chips? Or is it a nap or a bath that you are craving? If you are desiring food, you can use a tool like the hunger meter to help you determine what it is you want to eat. By assigning levels to your hunger (for example, ""1"" being ravenous and ""9"" being Thanksgiving day stuffed), the meter can help guide you as to what to eat, and can be especially helpful if impulsive or stress-related eating has become problematic. For example, if you are a ""4,"" on the hunger meter (that is, not that hungry, but ""snacky""), you might need a piece of fruit with a small handful of nuts. But if you are a ""1,"" you probably need a full meal. How to eat less meat and more plants2. Don't multitask while snacking. When we are less distracted and more mindful when eating, we are not only better able to appreciate the taste and texture of foods; we are also better able to determine when we have had enough to eat.That includes taking a break from screens, social media and texting. Disconnecting from all things digital can make you calmer too, which bodes well for eating, according to Lisa R. Young, registered dietitian nutritionist and author of ""Finally Full, Finally Slim: 30 Days to Permanent Weight Loss One Portion at a Time."" The next time you snack, try chewing slowly and savor every bite. This will help make snacking a lot more pleasurable. It will also help you avoid mindless nibbling and the excess calories that come with it.These chocolate smoothie muffins are rich in calcium.3. Be an opportunistic snacker. That means looking at snacks as opportunities to help fill nutrient gaps in your diet. Healthy snacks like carrot sticks and hummus, fruit and small portions of nuts provide important nutrients, and are all great snack choices, according to Nestle.For some fun new snack recipes that will boost your nutrition, try my omega-3 crackers, calcium-rich chocolate smoothie muffins and fiber-rich salted date caramel truffles.4. Plan and prep snacks ahead of time. Shopping and prepping snacks in advance will help to set you up for success in choosing healthier snacks.  Keep fruits and veggies washed, cut and at eye level in the fridge, so you can just grab and eat them, advised registered dietitian Bonnie Taub-Dix, creator of BetterThanDieting.com and author of ""Read It Before You Eat It: Taking You from Label to Table.""  Also, plan the timing of snacks so you don't find yourself ravenous during the day. For example, eating something every three to four hours can be helpful, especially if you have difficulty concentrating or feel sluggish when your blood sugar level drops.Brownies, truffles and pasta: Healthful food swaps you will love5. Design a snack-friendly kitchen. Visual cues go a long way in determining what we actually choose to eat.  In our home, I place a bowl filled with our favorite fruits on the kitchen table, so we are more likely to grab them when we are craving a snack.  It's also a good idea to clear your counters of less healthy but tempting visual cues like cookies, sweets and soft drinks, according to Taub-Dix. If you need to purchase foods that may serve as triggers (like those yummy semisweet chocolate morsels you use for baking), place them on higher shelves or hidden behind other foods. Keeping your kitchen organized, free of clutter and with fewer options of sweets or salty snacks can also help. Consumers who have five or more packages of crackers or salty snacks consume those foods at higher rates than consumers with fewer packages in their home, according to the NPD study.Lisa Drayer's omega-3 crackers are a healthy choice. 6.  Make simple swaps. If you have a sweet tooth, swap candy for dried fruit; premium ice cream for frozen banana ""nice"" cream and a cinnamon roll for cinnamon raisin toast spread with whipped cream cheese.  It can be fun to try snacking on healthier versions of your favorite indulgences.

"At 37, marathon runner Sara Hall is enjoying her sport more than ever","She says running has ""broken my heart a hundred times,"" but each moment of heartbreak would have seemed worthwhile as Sara Hall moved into second place on the final straight of this year's London Marathon. The dramatic finish saw a surging Hall overtake Ruth Chepngetich in a sprint finish having made up 40 seconds in little more than a mile by her husband's calculations. Her time of two hours, 22 minutes and one second improved her previous personal best by 15 seconds, and her second-place finish made her the first American to mount the podium at London in 14 years.The performance would have gone some way to atoning for the disappointment of pulling out of the Olympic Marathon Trials in Atlanta earlier this year -- likely one of the heartbreaks she had been referring to as she took to social media after the race.""This is the highlight of my career so far,"" Hall tells CNN Sport as she reflects on her London Marathon performance.Read MoreHall crosses the finish line in second place at the London Marathon.

Competitors were tested multiple times before traveling and also upon arrival in the UK. Wearing social distancing devices that would sound if they got too close to another person, athletes stayed in a bubble in a hotel the week leading up to the race with ""a little, tiny grass loop"" to train on, according to Hall. For the race itself, each athlete had their own Porta Potti -- ""every runner's dream,"" says Hall, rather than waiting in a long queue before rushing to the start line. Hall celebrates her performance at the London Marathon finish line. Rather than start in Greenwich in south London and finish in The Mall in the center of the British capital, the course was also altered to 19.6 laps of St James's Park and no crowds were in attendance -- something that posed a significant mental challenge. ""There were times I could just hear the echo of my footsteps out there because I was running completely alone,"" says Hall.""I really just had to self-motivate a lot out there because it was a lonely, very quiet run without spectators.

Daniil Medvedev hits underarm serve on his way to victory against Alexander Zverev,"Daniil Medvedev started his ATP Finals campaign in dominant form with a straight-sets victory against Alexander Zverev on Monday. The Russian won 6-3 6-4 after a bruising encounter, with both men looking exhausted by the end of the match. The first six games alone took more than 40 minutes to complete and were crammed full with lung-busting rallies. Despite the fatigue, Medvedev still had the presence of mind to successfully execute an underarm serve whilst 4-3 ahead in the second set. Zverev was able to return the cheeky serve but was unable to recover to win the point.""I didn't want to disrespect him (Zverev) but my wide serve was not working as well as I would like today and he was returning it good,"" Medvedev said after the match. Read More""I saw he was five meters behind the baseline and I had the ball close to my racket, so I was like 'just go for it.' It was just a move to win the point.""I'm happy that it worked because it's also smart."" It was Medvedev's first win at the ATP Finals and his third consecutive victory over Zverev, who continued to struggle with his second serve, winning just four of the 19 second points from it. In truth, the 2018 champion never really found his rhythm in the match after he hit four double faults in his first two service games.READ: Alexander Zverev overpowers Rafa Nadal at Paris MastersDaniil Medvedev said he did not intend to disrepect Alexander Zverev with his underarm serve.

DHS tries to self-correct succession order amid challenges to acting secretary's authority,"The Department of Homeland Security tried to self-correct its line of succession for the second time in the last three months over concerns about acting Secretary Chad Wolf's authority.Over the weekend, a federal judge ruled Wolf was not legally serving as acting secretary when he signed rules limiting applications and renewals for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.Wolf's legitimacy has been an ongoing struggle for the department and has threatened to derail policies and other actions put in place during his tenure. CNN reported Friday that there has been a renewed push to get Wolf confirmed as Homeland Security secretary before Inauguration Day, which if successful, could help alleviate legal challenges.  Trump fires director of Homeland Security agency who had rejected President's election conspiracy theoriesKirstjen Nielsen was the last person confirmed by the Senate as secretary of Homeland Security. Since her ouster in April 2019, the department has been operating with acting officials, throwing into question the authority of those who have succeeded her and raising doubts about the legitimacy of their actions.In August, the Government Accountability Office concluded that the appointments of Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli were named in an ""invalid order of succession"" and their appointments have been challenged in federal court. The report also detailed the line of succession at DHS, which includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator.Read MoreOn Saturday, DHS had Pete Gaynor, who is the Senate-confirmed FEMA administrator, temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf's legitimacy as acting chief of the department.Under one interpretation, Gaynor would be the lawfully serving acting secretary based on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. ""Out of an abundance of caution,"" Gaynor had to reissue the order of succession, according to DHS. His order, issued on September 10, appears to have been signed before Wolf's nomination was formally submitted to the Senate, leading to issues with timing.Several federal judges have raised concerns that Wolf was not lawfully appointed, a point not missed by Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who ruled in the DACA case.""The court wishes the Government well in trying to find its way out of this self-made thicket,"" he wrote in a footnote about Gaynor's previous order. House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, called Gaynor's move ""legal gymnastics"" that won't change the fact that department leadership made a ""massive error over a year ago in improperly designating an Acting Secretary.""""I hope Federal courts continue to rule as they have been: that Chad Wolf's appointment was illegal and his policies are invalid,"" Thompson wrote in a statement. ""Thankfully we will have better stewards of the Department in just two short months.""",2020-11-18T00:55:30Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/dhs-succession-order-wolf-acting-secretary/index.html,2020-11-18 09:02:49.309864,CNN,politics,0

'Lego Star Wars Holiday Special' review: Disney+ takes a nostalgic tour of 'Star Wars' history,"The 1978 ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" has become the stuff of legend for how notoriously, epically bad it was, which provides some indication that ""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" -- with that title alone -- knows precisely what it's doing. The resulting animated hour delivers a clever romp through ""Star Wars"" history, smartly snapped together and wrapped in a bright, colorful bow.The basic conceit of this Disney+ offering -- set after the most recent trilogy, and featuring the voices of a few cast members -- is that Rey takes a break from ""Life Day"" festivities to seek a better understanding of Jedi lore in order to better train Finn. (Life Day, incidentally, is a nod to the original special, for the 12 or so people who'll remember.)In the process, she and BB-8 visit the Jedi Temple and discover a time-traveling portal, one that allows her to parachute into various scenes from 40-some-odd years of ""Star Wars,"" interacting with key players in particularly cheeky ways.Obviously, the more steeped in ""Star Wars"" trivia viewers are, the more apt they'll be to enjoy it. At the same time, the program (directed by Ken Cunningham and written by David Shayne) rather neatly straddles the line between spoofing old-style holiday specials and embracing the sappier side of reminding people that such celebrations are about family and friendship, complete with ""Rudolph""-- style narration courtesy of Yoda.'The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special.'That tone neatly fits the Lego animated brand. As noted, the sundry ties to the actual universe include vocal cameos by Kelly Marie Tran, Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels, but the nostalgia goes a whole lot deeper than that. Plus, there are amusing little Lego-specific gags, like having a character's hair pop off and snap back on.Read MoreDisney+ has been particularly savvy about leveraging its various brands -- specifically, Marvel, ""Star Wars"" and the studio's animation library -- as the backbone in programming the service, from big splashy series like ""The Mandalorian"" to small interstitial items like a short featuring the Olaf character from ""Frozen.""On its face, this latest holiday special represents little more than a playful lark, and a welcome one for fans. But in its magical tour of George Lucas' galaxy, it's also reminder -- assuming one is needed -- of what a potent force ""Star Wars"" has been and remains as we approach the holidays, both real and imagined.""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" premieres Nov. 17 on Disney+.",2020-11-16T18:29:14Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/entertainment/the-lego-star-wars-holiday-special-review/index.html,2020-11-17 10:22:50.724990,CNN,entertainment,1
'The Crown' season four features Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana. Here's what you should know about them,"The fourth season of ""The Crown"" premiered on Sunday and audiences were introduced to a slew of new characters drawn from the pages of history, including Princess Diana and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Netflix drama -- which is based on real-life events but not entirely factual -- follows the lives of the British royal family from the death of King George VI in 1952, when Queen Elizabeth II takes the throne. Here are some facts that you should know about the iconic women while watching the new season:Princess DianaThe late Princess Diana was born on July 1, 1961, in Sandringham in a home close to the royal estate in which the Windsors spent much of their time, according to the royal household website.  Diana had two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, and a younger brother, Charles. Sarah and Prince Charles briefly dated in the late 1970s and Sarah eventually set her younger sister up with the royal heir.Diana worked as a nanny and a kindergarten teacher shortly before she married Prince Charles in 1981.Diana was only 20 when she married Charles -- he was 32.Diana shared details about her life with British biographer Andrew Morton who in 1992 published ""Diana: Her True Story"" which details her bulimia and suicide attempts during the 1980s.Diana became the first royal bride to omit the promise to ""obey"" her husband in her wedding vows. Both Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle followed their late mother-law's lead by leaving the words out of their vows.Diana played a major role in changing the perception of HIV/Aids in the mid-1980s after being photographed shaking the hand of a man suffering with the disease without gloves.Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997, along with her then-boyfriend Dodi Fayed. Diana's two children, Prince William and Prince Harry have been vocal in their blaming of the paparazzi for their mother's death. Read MoreMargaret ThatcherMargaret Thatcher was the first woman to serve as British prime minister. She also became the longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century after nearly 12 years in the jobThatcher was given her nickname, the ""Iron Lady,"" by Soviet journalists after a 1976 speech in which she condemned communism.Thatcher worked as a food scientist before entering politics. She had graduated from Oxford University in 1947 with a chemistry degree.She married wealthy industrialist Denis Thatcher in 1951 and gave birth to twins Carol and Mark in 1953, according to a biography in Britannica.Thatcher's relationship with Queen Elizabeth II has been portrayed in the media as ""frosty,"" but Thatcher seems to contradict this in her memoir saying, ""I always found the Queen's attitude toward the work of government absolutely correct ... stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' were just too good not to make up.""Thatcher survived an attempted assassination in 1984 when the Irish Republican Army bombed a hotel where she and other top government officials were assembled.Thatcher died of a stroke in London at the age of 87 on April 8, 2013.",2020-11-15T21:44:57Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/entertainment/the-crown-season-four-trnd/index.html,2020-11-16 11:10:32.801262,CNN,world,0
Lankford argues he did 'step in' Friday and had private conversation with GSA over Biden transition process,"Sen. James Lankford said Monday that he did ""step in"" with the General Services Administration late last week over the presidential transition process -- and seemed satisfied with the agency's handling of the matter, although there is no indication yet that Joe Biden will start getting the intelligence briefings that the Oklahoma Republican said he wanted the President-elect to receive.""I did step in. I did talk to them on Friday,"" Lankford said, declining to provide details about whom he had spoken with and what they said. ""My staff has been involved; I've been involved.""Lankford said he talked to the agency about the process it needs to take to determine if Biden is the President-elect and a formal transition should begin, including intelligence briefings for the new administration.""We talked through the process, where they're coming from. I talked through what I see is a good process, but I'm just not going to go into all the details,"" said Lankford, who chairs a Senate subcommittee that oversees the agency.Lankford defended the decision by the General Services Administration to not ascertain that Biden is the President-elect, arguing the agency cannot make such a determination with one of the candidates disputing the election and before results are certified by the states.Read More""There's no way they can ascertain,"" Lankford said. ""GSA is not the electors.""The comments come after Lankford drew attention last week when he said that Biden should be getting briefed on national security matters by November 13.""There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that. If that's not occurring by Friday, I will step in,""  Lankford told radio station KRMG on November 11. ""This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.""  Lankford said Monday that Biden should get the regular classified intelligence briefings that he received as a candidate. But he argued that Biden should not have access to the Presidential Daily Brief -- or daily summary of high-level intelligence -- until he's officially declared President-elect.On Saturday, Lankford told the conservative outlet Newsmax: ""I'm not in a hurry, necessarily, to get Joe Biden these briefings.  It's been interesting how the media -- national media, not this network but others -- have twisted this term 'step in.' ""Lankford claimed Monday he was not being inconsistent: ""Nothing changed for me."" He argued that he's ""concerned"" about the shortened transition process and wants to make sure that Biden gets some level of briefings as Trump disputes the election results.""I'd really not like to have an intel gap in the meantime,"" Lankford said.Asked when the drop-dead date is for Trump, Lankford pointed to December 14, which is when the Electoral College casts its ballots, ""when the whole country is certified.""One of the first official steps of a transition from one presidential administration to the next is that the GSA administrator would sign a letter to release funds to the Biden transition team through a process called ascertainment, a step administrator Emily W. Murphy has not yet taken, while Trump has refused to concede the election.Following Lankford's initial comments, a number of senior Republicans in the Senate also called last week for Biden to have access to classified security briefings, including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who as president pro tempore is the most senior Republican in the chamber, and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally. Some GOP lawmakers cited the official report of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which described how national security had been negatively impacted during the transition from the Bill Clinton presidency to George W. Bush's.

Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are poised to return to a Manhattan social scene that no longer welcomes them,"If the celebrations that spilled into the streets of New York City in the wake of Joe Biden's victory made one thing clear, it's that the Trumps aren't welcome here.For the President, who changed his primary residency last year to Florida, that's perhaps no major loss, but for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the block parties celebrating the demise of the Trump administration may provide a glimpse of what awaits them once they exit the White House. Now that their political lives in Washington are over -- the question for this once-golden power couple is what their time in the political spotlight has meant for their brand, particularly in their old Manhattan stomping grounds.""[The President] was so awful and divisive about New York, saying it's a nightmare or that it's empty, or a has-been,"" said Jill Kargman, a writer, Upper East Side resident and daughter of the former chairman of Chanel who has socialized at events with the couple in the past. ""No one here is going to forget that. To even come back here after everything he's said, it's not going to work.""In the days before they were denizens of the White House, Kushner and Trump inhabited a rarified slice of New York society.Read MoreThey frequented the Met Gala, she in a strapless royal blue gown one year and a backless scarlet jumpsuit the next, and the Vanity Fair party for the Tribeca Film Festival. She made the rounds at fashion events, attending Carolina Herrera runway shows, a Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts celebration for Italian designer Valentino and the Glamour Women of the Year Awards.Now, though, they may not like what they find if they return. Trump's eldest children split on his path forwardA glimpse of what likely awaits them was on display in Times Square last month where the anti-Trump Lincoln Project took out ad space on a pair of Times Square billboards showing their smiling faces alongside coronavirus death statistics and an illustration of body bags. When the couple threatened to file a lawsuit, the group also placed the image on a barge to circle Mar-a-Lago and on trucks that circled Trump Tower, according to tweets from the project co-founder. New York isn't the only place to call home, of course. While the couple has been tight-lipped about where they intend to reside post-White House, they have kept their sprawling Upper East Side apartment, an East Wing official said, and they are eyeing the possibility of spending more time in New Jersey, according to a source familiar with the couple's thinking. Two sources who have worked with the couple believe they may end up in Florida, specifically the Palm Beach area. Trump has accumulated a number of acquaintances in the state, both socially and politically, and in recent months she visited Florida at least five times, hosting campaign events in Republican areas such as Sarasota, but also making appearances in Miami. A Florida home-base would not only provide Trump a platform should she eye a future political career there, and it would also keep the couple clear of facing New York. Mar-a-Lago is not an option for their permanent residence, however, according to a source with knowledge of the family dynamics. Though Ivanka Trump has a private guest house there, Mar-a-Lago is the preferred home of the first lady and she and the President's daughter have a frosty relationship.Washington, meanwhile, may no longer hold much appeal. ""They only know the DC of being in power,"" said one senior Republican. ""Wait until they realize no one is taking their calls.""Indeed, inside the White House, according to sources, the expectation is high for them to return to Manhattan -- even if it means an inhospitable homecoming for the pair. For one thing, either may decide to return to their respective family businesses, where they each worked before the White House. Representatives for Ivanka Trump and Kushner Companies did not respond to requests for comment on this story. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization referred calls to the White House.A White House official said of Kushner that ""there are a wealth of opportunities for him to explore,"" pointing to his involvement in criminal justice reform and the Olympics, among other matters. The official added, ""There will be plenty of available opportunities, and right now it's premature to speculate.""Financial obligations could be a factor  Kushner was previously CEO of Kushner Companies, the real-estate firm founded by his father, Charles Kushner. The company is largely family-run, in part because the Kushners prefer it that way, according to a person familiar with his thinking.Charles Kushner is likely to expect his son to return to the business, this person said, and with the relationships Jared Kushner has established in recent years with leaders of deep-pocketed Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, he could potentially leverage those connections going forward in the family business or other business ventures.Trump, too, left her position at the Trump Organization upon moving to Washington, but she retained passive stakes in the business. She receives fixed guaranteed payments for some of her assets as well as a financial interest in the Trump International Hotel Washington, DC, for which she played a key role in closing the deal, and which is home to the first ""Spa by Ivanka Trump."" She reported $3.9 million in income from the hotel in 2019.And though she has sought to position herself as a sunny, polished figure who is distinct from her father's brash ways, she is valued at the company for her ability to channel his whims and preferences. Several months before the 2016 opening of the DC hotel, she made an impression with staff by comparing three identical-looking shades of gold painted on the ornate filigree atop one of the arched doorways in the hotel's ballroom and declaring one the obvious choice for a Trump property.While the couple remains wealthy, their financial obligations could factor into their post-White House decision making.While working at the White House, Kushner has taken out two loans from Bank of America, one in 2017 and one in 2019, each ranging between $5 million and $25 million, according to his financial disclosure form. Both loans, which were taken out jointly with limited liability companies, are due in 2022. The family business, which owns residential properties with hundreds of tenants, will also likely face challenges from the pending housing crisis. One $285 million loan, taken out in 2016 for a Times Square retail complex, is underwater after one tenant filed for bankruptcy, according to TreppWire, a real estate data analytics firm.For her part, Trump shut down her namesake fashion brand in 2018, and while the apparel line had performed well the year of the election, it suffered in the aftermath as anti-Trump boycotts of her line took hold.The legal reckoning awaiting Donald Trump if he loses the election And they face legal headaches back in New York, where Trump is being sued in federal court, along with her father and two eldest brothers, for allegedly collaborating with a fraudulent marketing scheme to prey on vulnerable and financially struggling investors, claims they have denied.Kushner, too, has faced his share of legal concerns back home, where Brooklyn federal prosecutors were examining his family company's use of an investment-for-immigration program, although that probe doesn't appear to have been active in about two years.Political ambitionsIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner listen as President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Atlantic Aviation on September 22, 2020 in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)One wild card is whether Trump's taste for politics will stick as she has gotten a sense of her power to generate big political dollars. Since August, she headlined 38 events in multiple states and hosted nine fundraisers, garnering more than $35 million for her father's campaign. She has offered an alternative to the massive crowds, chants of ""lock her up"" and throngs disco-dancing to ""YMCA"" at her father's rallies. At political events, she often sticks to speaking about matters she feels her father has succeeded in advancing, including job growth, economic stability, family tax credit and entrepreneurship.Trump, however, recognizes that her future -- now more than ever -- is tied to her father, said a person familiar with the matter, adding that she came into the White House as Kushner, but now she has gone ""Full MAGA."" Several people told CNN in recent months that Trump is considering her own potential political future, which may be driving the more nuanced positions she has taken in contrast to with her brothers' strident remarks on matters like immigration and, more recently, alleged voter fraud.Since Election Day, the couple has kept a low profile, although a White House official tells CNN that both Trump and Kushner have been working at the White House. Kushner, CNN has reported, has been part of the team tasked with fomenting a legal path forward for Trump's baseless fight against the outcome of the election, while privately attempting to cajole the President into accepting his inevitable loss. While ballots were still being tabulated in battleground states, three days after Election Day, Trump tweeted that legal votes should be counted, but ""every illegally cast vote should not."" But she added, ""This is not a partisan statement,"" noting, ""free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy."" Earlier this week, she appeared to validate the vote counting that has continued well past Election Day by celebrating media organizations declaring that the President won in Alaska after a flurry of outstanding ballots were counted.It struck a softer tone than her father's nonstop baseless railing against what he has called a ""fraud"" and ""hoax"" voting process.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP,      Getty Images)Despite their presence at Manhattan society events pre-White House, including parties thrown by the Kushner family-owned New York Observer newspaper, which drew the likes of Rupert Murdoch, Padma Lakshmi, Chuck Close, Katie Couric and Michael Bloomberg, the two have never been known to maintain an extensive circle of friends in New York, people familiar with the matter said, instead spending much of their free time with family and acquaintances from their Orthodox Jewish community. And while Kushner is close with his brother, Joshua Kushner, as well as a friend from Harvard, financier Nitin Saigal, and Trump remains friendly with Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng, according to people familiar with the matter, some of their other New York pals have hit hurdles in recent years.Kushner's friend Adam Neumann resigned as CEO amid disarray at the company he founded, WeWork. And Ken Kurson, a close friend of the couple, was arrested on federal cyberstalking charges in late October.Outside of their immediate social circle, they are unlikely to receive the types of invitations they scored pre-White House. Vogue Editor-in-Chief and Condé Nast Artistic Director Anna Wintour has made no secret of her distaste for the President and his politics, and Wintour's preferences determine invitations to the Met Gala. Trump's currency as a glossy fashion magazine feature star -- which she last flaunted in Harper's Bazaar in September 2016, during the thick of the campaign, wearing a $6,990 Carolina Herrera gown while perched on a ladder overlooking the Manhattan skyline -- has declined as well. One former editor at a prestigious magazine who remains an in demand stylist said Trump will struggle with reentering the fashion orbit. ""The fashion industry is a very liberal, Democratic leaning group,"" he said, ""and I just don't see them welcoming them back -- professionally or socially -- with open arms.""New York tabloids, which helped propel the President to fame and chronicled the social rise of his children broke in recent days from promoting the administration's agenda, with even the New York Post urging the President to end his ""stolen election"" complaints. Their New York neighbors, meanwhile, may have similar gripes. Co-inhabitants of their apartment complex include the President's former -- and now estranged -- lawyer Michael Cohen and his daughter Samantha, who has described Trump snubbing her in their building's lobby, despite having come over to dine on her dad's ""famous"" lasagna.""One time she told on me after she saw me smoking cigarettes outside of our building,"" Samantha Cohen told Vanity Fair. ""It was so lame.""They may find some support close to home -- a US Secret Service source said the two have been a favored assignment because they are ""very good to their detail."" They get to know them, he said, and ask after their families. Other employees on the family payroll say they are caring employers. One nanny (there have been up to three employed at once, per a source familiar) has been with them for several years, and ""is treated like a member of the family,"" said a hair stylist who counted Trump as a client and who often witnessed her interactions with others.But New Yorkers broadly aren't exactly aligned with the couple's political leanings. In 2016, about 9 out of 10 Manhattanites voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. With more than 60% of the state's votes counted as of Thursday night, Biden is projected to win Manhattan by a similar margin.That may portend reactions like the one Kargman said she could foresee displaying if she encounters Trump back in Manhattan. ""I would yell 'Shame!' at her, like to Cersei Lannister in 'Game of Thrones,'"" Kargman said. ""Just yell, 'shame, shame, shame,' at her, in that same rhythmic pattern.""CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect that billboard images of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were not removed but also placed on a barge and trucks.",2020-11-14T14:30:29Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/14/politics/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-post-white-house/index.html,2020-11-16 11:29:06.450097,CNN,politics,0
SpaceX launch: Four astronauts take off aboard Crew Dragon bound for ISS,"A SpaceX spacecraft carrying four astronauts soared into outer space Sunday — marking the kick off of what NASA hopes will be years of the company helping to keep the International Space Station fully staffed.NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and Soichi Noguchi, an astronaut with Japan's space agency,  are now in orbit, riding aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that is expected to dock with the ISS on Monday at 11 pm ET. That means the crew will spend 27 hours in orbit as the spacecraft slowly maneuvers toward its destination. The trip would have been shorter if the Crew Dragon were able to launch on Saturday, as NASA first planned, because the ISS would have lined up in such away as to allow the spacecraft to reach the space station in about eight hours. But bad weather brought by Hurricane Eta forced launch officials to delay takeoff to Sunday evening.The capsule has a working restroom, and the astronauts will have time to get some sleep as the fully autonomous vehicle maneuvers through orbit while SpaceX and NASA officials in Houston, Texas, and Hawthorne, California, watch over the journey.This is a landmark mission for NASA and the company because it is the first fully operational crewed mission for SpaceX, following up a test mission in May that carried NASA astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken, both test pilots, to the space station.Read MoreElon Musk may have Covid-19, should quarantine during SpaceX astronaut launch Sunday, NASA saysBut this mission is not a test: SpaceX's Crew Dragon was officially certified as a spacecraft worthy of carrying people last week, paving the way for it to begin making the trip relatively routine, carrying astronauts from a variety of backgrounds.On this mission, for example, both Walker and Noguchi have backgrounds in physics. The Crew-1 team is slated to conduct all sorts of experiments during their six-month stay on the ISS, including research into how microgravity affects human heart tissue. They'll also attempt to grow radishes in space to build on studies designed to figure out how food might be grown to sustain deep-space exploration missions.Sunday's mission had been briefly thrown into question after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed on Twitter that he was experiencing symptoms and was being tested for Covid-19, prompting NASA to carry out a contact tracing effort to ensure no essential personnel for the launch might have been exposed.Officials said that effort was completed by Friday night, and they had no cause for concern. Musk said on Saturday that he ""most likely"" had a ""moderate case of covid.""The United States spent nearly a decade without the ability to launch astronauts into space after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, and NASA was forced to rely on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to get astronauts to the ISS, which the space agency says left the multibillion-dollar orbiting laboratory understaffed. As many as 13 astronauts were on board at one time in 2009. That number has occasionally dropped to as low as three on several occasions, which leaves fewer people to help run experiments and help keep the space station well maintained. With this launch, it will grow to seven.SpaceX developed the Crew Dragon capsule under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which, for the first time in the space agency's history, handed over much of the design, development and testing of new human-rated spacecraft to the private sector. NASA awarded SpaceX and Boeing fixed-price contracts worth $2.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, to get the job done. Development of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is still delayed because of major software issues detected during a test mission last year, but officials say that vehicle could be in operation next year.Because these vehicles will technically be owned by SpaceX and Boeing, with NASA serving as a customer that buys missions for astronauts, the companies will also be able to use their vehicles to fly tourists, private researchers or anyone else who can afford a $50 million-plus ticket.That decision wasn't without controversy, particularly in the Commercial Crew Program's early days. But Crew Dragon's success could be seen as a huge win for folks at NASA who hope to rely more extensively on that contracting style to help accomplish the space agency's goals.",2020-11-16T00:47:42Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/tech/spacex-nasa-launch-crew-dragon/index.html,2020-11-16 11:41:06.484426,CNN,technology,0
Lewis Hamilton equals Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles,"Lewis Hamilton has become accustomed to making history and, at a rain-soaked Turkish Grand Prix, the Englishman put his name in the record books once again as he equaled Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles. To win Formula One's drivers' championship at Istanbul Park, the Mercedes driver needed to finish ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas and did so with ease in often treacherous conditions, securing a fourth successive title by winning the race after starting sixth. Lewis Hamilton, Formula One's voice and conscienceLast month Hamilton, 35, surpassed Schumacher's all-time record of 91 Grand Prix wins to become the sport's most successful racer and had long since broken the German's career pole-positions record. Should he remain in the sport, Hamilton will be widely expected to add to his tally of world titles. But, whatever he achieves in the years ahead, his place in F1's pantheon is assured.""For all the kids out there who dream the impossible, you can do it too -- I believe in you guys,"" said Hamilton on his radio after crossing the finishing line for his 94th Grand Prix win.Read MoreHamilton celebrates after winning the Turkish Grand Prix. It was a brilliant drive from one of the all-time greats. After poor practice and qualifying sessions this weekend, question marks were raised as to whether Hamilton could win in Turkey. In wet conditions, it was Hamilton's decisive call on tyres which ultimately proved pivotal, with the Mercedes driver taking control halfway through the race. After victory was achieved, Hamilton embraced his team and, with tears in his eyes, told Sky Sports he was ""lost for words."" ""I have to start with saying such a huge thank you to all the guys that are here, and all the guys that are back at the factory ... I wouldn't be able to do this if I didn't join this team and the journey we've been on has been monumental,"" he said. Lewis Hamilton vs. Michael Schumacher: Who is the greatest? ""I want to say a big thanks to team LH for sticking with me all these years, and to my family. We dreamed of this when I was young and this is way, way beyond our dreams.""Hamilton, who has equaled a record many thought was untouchable when Schumacher won his seventh title in 2004, received congratulatory messages from his fellow drivers, sports stars from around the world and the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""Massively deserved,"" tweeted former world champion Nico Rosberg, a former Mercedes teammate of Hamilton and one of the few drivers to finish ahead of Hamilton in the championship during the Briton's 14-year career. Former Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand tweeted that his compatriot was the ""greatest sportsman this country has ever produced -- no doubts."" Johnson tweeted: ""An impressive victory -- well done @LewisHamilton! You have made us all so proud.""Racing Point's Sergio Perez finished over 31 seconds behind Hamilton in second, while Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third. In finishing 14th, Bottas -- the only man who could have denied Hamilton the title -- was lapped by his teammate and finished with no points.Hamilton with Mercedes chief Toto Wolff. Driving in the same Mercedes machinery, Bottas' performance illustrated just how superior a talent Hamilton is. No one has come close to challenging the world champion during this truncated season and he secured the title with three races still remaining, having won four races in a row and 10 of 14 races so far this year. No driver has been as successful on the track as Hamilton, and no F1 world champion has used his stature like Hamilton, the sport's first and only Black world champion in its 70-year history. The 35-year-old has long been the face of his sport -- his domination and heart-on-sleeve personality has made him arguably the most recognizable British sportsman on the planet -- but, in 2020 especially, he became one of British sport's leading voices supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and, consequently, his sport's voice too.Ahead of the Turkish Grand Prix, Hamilton said campaigning for equal rights had made him ""much prouder"" than the prospect of a seventh world title. But as the checkered flag was waved, it became clear how much this title meant this once-in-a-generation talent. An emotional Hamilton celebrates with his Mercedes team after the race. ""My whole life I probably have, secretly, dreamt as high as this but it felt so far fetched. Seven is just unimaginable,"" Hamilton said on the podium. ""I feel like I'm only just getting started, it's really weird. I feel physically in great shape and mentally, this year, has been the hardest probably for millions of people. ""I know things always look great from here on the big stage, (but) It's no different for us athletes. This has been a challenge, I didn't know how to get through. I managed to keep my head above water and stay focused ...

Fight winter blues by changing your mindset,"Darkness covers the Norwegian city of Tromsø from late November through January, a long, polar night when the sun never rises at all. The island community, which is more than 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, is flanked by snowy peaks and frigid water. Northern lights flicker in the sky there.""If winter were a place, it would be Tromsø,"" said Kari Leibowitz, a doctoral student of psychology at Stanford University, who spent a year there for her graduate research. Leibowitz arrived in the Arctic city hoping to study seasonal affective disorder, the seasonal depression that some experience in the darkest time of year. Erick Jensen (left), of Seattle, and Ruth Reyes (right), of LA, take in the Yosemite Valley November 9, following the weekend's snowstorm in Yosemite National Park, California. This condition is a big problem. Prevalence of seasonal depression in North America increases with latitude; in New Hampshire, nearly 10% of the population is estimated to suffer from SAD. And while New Hampshire's northernmost town sits at 45 degrees north, Tromsø is at 69 degrees north — the Norwegian city is much, much closer to the North Pole. Everything Leibowitz learned as a psychology undergraduate suggested Tromsø would be ground zero for SAD. ""When winter gets more extreme, you should have a higher prevalence of seasonal affective disorder, and you should have worse seasonal affective disorder,"" Leibowitz said. But after Leibowitz arrived, her Norwegian graduate adviser explained that in Tromsø, mental health and well-being actually remain pretty stable through the winter. Abruptly, Leibowitz's question changed. ""What is it that allows people living in this Arctic city, where the sun doesn't rise for two months ... to thrive?"" she asked. Her findings, published in a recent paper for the International Journal of Wellbeing, offer hope for those who dread the season's first snowfall. Read MoreHer research suggests that SAD isn't just about the dark and cold weather, but something Leibowitz calls ""wintertime mindset,"" an individual's ideas and beliefs about the season. Good or bad, we all have a mindset about winter — and what we believe seems to inform our mental health. In Tromsø, where many respondents in Leibowitz's research expressed positive associations with winter, seasonal depression isn't so bad.How to guard against seasonal affective disorder in the pandemic's winter monthsIt's more important than ever to address your ""I hate being outside in winter"" dread, since the pandemic shows no signs of abating and playing 6 feet apart outside with others is much safer than playing inside in winter. And masks make sense when you're having fun outside in the cold weather, since they can keep you warm (and safer). If you are a dedicated winter hater, though, it doesn't mean you're doomed to a lifetime of winter blues. The good news, Leibowitz said, is that mindset can be surprisingly flexible.Refocus your thoughts on wintertime pleasuresIf you want to change your perspective, Leibowitz said an initial step is to take a close look at what you already believe. ""Shifting your mindset comes from first examining your mindset,"" she said. ""Think to yourself: 'All right, what do I think of when I think about winter?'""For some, imagining winter evokes a long list of frustrations and hassles: Shoveling snow, icy sidewalks, heavy clothing and overcast skies are common gripes. But if that's all that comes to mind, it's a sign you could benefit from overhauling your perspective.Make the most of the year's shortest day""There's a lot of evidence that mindset can be changed, but it often takes this kind of deliberate intervention,"" Leibowitz said. There's no one-size-fits-all solution for doing that. Instead, Leibowitz suggested you sit down to list the things you enjoy about winter.For Leibowitz, a self-described indoors type, the list of wintertime joys includes getting cozy with a book and streaming movies. In Tromsø, she loved cafes that used twinkling lights and candles to create an inviting atmosphere. Cultures across the globe celebrate holidays in the winter, traditions that bring special foods and rituals. Out of doors, you'll find wintry joys that are just as fleeting as summer heat. A ""winter happiness"" list might feature the smell of fresh snow, or the sound of trees crackling in the cold. Midwinter is a time to gather around outdoor bonfires and discover ice formations, too. And while winter can be a time of great stillness, every day brings small transformations in the natural world — just looking out a window at snowy streets or bare-branched trees is part of the experience.  What does the data say about beating winter blues?In her social psychology research, Leibowitz studied the phenomena of SAD across a whole community. But her findings mirror research by psychologist Kelly Rohan, a professor at the University of Vermont who has been running clinical trials on SAD for two decades. With a lab in chilly Burlington, Vermont, she works with participants who face months of extreme cold, snow and darkness.Rohan in recent years has contrasted the two primary treatments for seasonal depression. The first is light therapy, which uses exposure to powerful artificial lights to mimic the sunshine we get in warmer months. Another approach is cognitive behavioral therapy, talk therapy focused on changing beliefs and behaviors. Foods to boost your mood, now that you really need itSide-by-side comparisons show that in the first year of treatment, light therapy and CBT are about even in their effectiveness. ""If it were a horse race, it would be a dead heat,"" Rohan said. But differences emerged in the second year.""When we follow people after treatment is over for a second year, we have observed better outcomes following CBT relative to light therapy,"" Rohan said. ""Less severe symptoms in the winter, and fewer of what we call 'recurrences'... the full-blown return of symptoms in the future.""In CBT for seasonal depression, Rohan uses a ""seasonal beliefs questionnaire,"" which asks participants to rate their agreement with a series of statements, including ""dark, gloomy days are depressing,"" and ""I'm stuck in a rut in the winter."" Part of her methodology for CBT is to question those beliefs. ""We say: 'What's the evidence for that? Is there any other way to think of that?'"" she explained. ""We reframe that thought so it's a little less extreme, so it would have a little less effect on your mood."" The goal isn't to get participants to love winter. Rather, Rohan's approach is designed the create some mental flexibility, leaving room for slightly different beliefs about the season.In many ways, the ""cognitive"" part of cognitive behavior therapy aligns with the mindset that Leibowitz studies — and Rohan's research offers a blueprint for how those facing SAD can experience lasting change.But do you have to go outside?Of course, the Norwegians who Leibowitz met in her year living in Tromsø don't just sit inside thinking about winter. The country is famously outdoorsy. ""People are sort of out and about, dressed up and enjoying winter,"" Leibowitz said. Her adviser and co-author on the study, Joar Vittersø, a professor of social psychology at the University of Tromsø, would sometimes commute to the university on cross-country skis. And even if you don't live in a place where roads turn into ski trails, getting outside can be a mood reset. You've probably heard it before: Contact with the natural world has broad benefits for mental health, a finding that's supported by study after study. People who get 120 minutes of nature time in each week are healthier and happier. Getting outside is generally a really good idea.But while CBT treatments for seasonal depression do attempt to change your habits — that's the ""behavior"" part of CBT — Rohan said getting outside isn't a strict requirement for improving your mental health. ""If you like being outside, then yes,"" she said, go out and play in the snow.

Obama's book tour doubles as a warning about 'deeply divided' media landscape ,"A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here. When Barack Obama and his editors at Penguin Random House's Crown Publishing picked this week to publish the first volume of his memoirs, ""A Promised Land,"" they hoped that the election results would be clear, that Obama's vice president Joe Biden would be busy with transition work, and that there wouldn't be any widespread unrest.They turned out to be right on all three counts: Tuesday is a wide-open launchpad for Obama's book, which is expected to be the best-selling title of the year, just as Michelle Obama's ""Becoming"" was in 2018. But they also expected that Obama and the memoir would be competing for attention with President Trump, and that's true too. Trump is continuing to thrash around on Twitter, saying ""I concede nothing"" and spreading lies about widespread fraud. So Obama's interviews and public appearances are about his time in office, yes, but they're also about Trump's misconduct, and about whether Biden will be able to restore any normalcy. Judging from his comments so far, Obama is clearly concerned that the information universe has changed in ways that are destabilizing to democracy. Let's take a look...Read More ""The single biggest threat to our democracy""On Monday morning The Atlantic is publishing Jeffrey Goldberg's wide-ranging interview with Obama. In it, Obama talks about the ""common narrative"" provided by past anchors like Walter Cronkite, back when broadcast towers and printing presses limited who could be heard and when.""I come out of this book very worried about the degree to which we do not have a common baseline of fact and a common story,"" he told Goldberg. ""We don't have a Walter Cronkite describing the tragedy of Kennedy's assassination but also saying to supporters and detractors alike of the Vietnam War that this is not going the way the generals and the White House are telling us. Without this common narrative democracy becomes very tough.""Later in the interview, Goldberg asked, ""Is this new malevolent information architecture bending the moral arc away from justice?""""I think it is the single biggest threat to our democracy,"" Obama said. ""I think Donald Trump is a creature of this, but he did not create it. He may be an accelerant of it, but it preceded him and will outlast him. I am deeply troubled by how we address it.""The genie is gone In the interview, Obama exhibited his familiarity with nightmares like QAnon and a realist attitude toward the near-future. ""You can't put the genie back in the bottle,"" he told Goldberg. ""You're not going to eliminate the internet, you're not going to eliminate the thousand stations on the air with niche viewerships designed for every political preference. Without this it becomes very difficult for us to tackle big things. It becomes hard for us to say, 'Hey, we have a pandemic here, it's deadly; it's serious; let's put partisanship aside; let's listen to Anthony Fauci because he's been studying stuff like this for a long time. We may not get everything exactly right, because science works iteratively, but let's hew as closely as we can to the science. Let's do what science tells us to do to save lives.' That becomes harder to do.""The interview is available on TheAtlantic.com...Obama's other interviewsHis sit-down with Gayle King aired on ""CBS Sunday Morning."" She asked, ""Seventy-two million people voted for Donald Trump. What does that say to you about the state of this country?""""Well, what it says is that we are still deeply divided,"" Obama said. ""The power of that alternative worldview that's presented in the media that those voters consume, it carries a lot of weight.""The media also came up repeatedly in Obama's interview with Scott Pelley on ""60 Minutes."" This quote stood out: ""I think we're going to have to work with the media and with the tech companies to find ways to inform the public better about the issues and to -- bolster the standards that ensure we can separate truth from fiction. I think that we have to work at a local level.""

"From love to thug, what President-elect Biden means for North Korea","North Korea has still not reacted to the United States' presidential election. Its silence speaks volumes.According to analysts, it's highly unlikely that President-elect Joe Biden would have been North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's preferred candidate.President Donald Trump has been unique among American leaders for his willingness to personally engage with Kim, providing him with a sense of legitimacy on the world stage, even though those efforts have since stalled.""I do think North Korea would be disappointed that Trump didn't win,"" said Ambassador Joseph Yun, a former US special representative for North Korea policy under both Presidents Obama and Trump. ""For them, Trump was a big deal, they had three summit meetings, unprecedented meetings.""Read MoreThe highly unusual relationship was underscored by the countless missives, described by Trump as ""love letters,"" that the two men exchanged during Trump's four years in office. Biden, on the other hand, has been brutal in his criticism of Trump's engagement with Kim, which according to the president-elect weakened US sanctions. Biden called Kim a ""thug"" during the last presidential debate and has been highly critical of North Korea throughout the entirety of this year's presidential campaign. It's unclear what comes next for Biden. He has outlined his priorities on entering the White House and North Korea does not feature, nor is a meeting likely any time soon. Unlike Trump, Biden has made it clear he would be unwilling to sit down with Kim without preconditions. But precedent suggests North Korea has a tendency to stage some kind of provocation in the early stages of a new US administration. Pyongyang fired a missile just weeks after President Trump was inaugurated in 2017, setting the tone for a volatile and tense year.Experts are split as to whether North Korea will feel the need to do the same for Biden.

Ted Cruz calls Democratic senator an 'ass' following Senate floor mask dispute,"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on Monday called Sen. Sherrod Brown ""a complete ass"" following a tense dispute over mask wearing on the Senate floor between the Ohio Democrat and Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan.The dispute, captured in a video clip that has now gone viral, took place when Brown asked Sullivan to wear a mask while speaking as he presided over the Senate, a request that Sullivan refused to comply with.Brown, who wore a mask as he spoke, said, ""I'd start by asking the presiding officer to please wear a mask as he speaks."" Sullivan, who was not wearing a mask, responded tersely, ""I don't wear a mask when I'm speaking, like most senators, I don't need your instruction.""Cruz criticized Brown over the incident in a tweet on Monday, writing, ""This is idiotic. @SherrodBrown is being a complete ass. He wears a mask to speak—when nobody is remotely near him—as an ostentatious sign of fake virtue.""  Sullivan addressed his heated exchange with Brown over masks Tuesday evening on Fox News, accusing the Democrat of seeking to ""lecture"" him. Read More""Some of these far-left senators like Senator Brown just can't help themselves on their desire to want to lecture people on these kinds of issues, whether it's lecturing other US senators or lecturing working families, and I think it's a put-off,"" Sullivan said. ""People recognize the challenges -- we're going to get through these challenges -- but to be lectured or preached to by senior officials is something that I think is not, not, I certainly didn't appreciate.""Brown told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""Prime Time"" later Tuesday that ""Senator Cruz doesn't have an intimate relationship with the truth in much of his public life.""""The fact is that every time a senator stands up and speaks, there is a Senate stenographer about six feet away, and senators that don't wear masks are putting them at risk,"" he said. ""I know that Ted Cruz doesn't see the Senate stenographer because she is -- it's always a she in these cases -- one of those essential workers that usually doesn't get paid a lot of money and exposes themselves, those essential workers, to the public and then goes home anxious at night about potentially infecting their families.""The series of events marks the latest flare-up on Capitol Hill over mask wearing and comes amid a deadly nationwide surge in coronavirus cases. A number of members of Congress have either tested positive or gone into quarantine following Covid-19 exposure in recent days. While partisan finger-pointing is a frequent occurrence in Congress, it is highly unusual for a member to refer to a colleague by an obscenity. An obscure Senate rule, known as Senate Rule 19, prohibits a senator from impugning another while on the floor. Cruz's remarks, however, came via Twitter and not while on the floor.  Cruz went on to say in his tweet that Sullivan was ""over 50 feet away"" from his fellow senator, adding that ""last I checked 50 feet is more than 6 feet."" It's advisable, however, to wear masks indoors when other people are around even if 6 feet of distance can be maintained. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance indicates that distancing is not a substitute for mask use when indoors. That's because virus-laden particles can float in the air and accumulate in rooms. ""Wear masks when less than 6 feet apart from other people or indoors,"" the CDC website states in an explanation on steps to protect yourself at a social gathering.Additionally, Cruz's tweet was misleading, as Brown appeared to be referring to the staffers who were just a few feet away from Sullivan while he was maskless. Brown made clear during a press call with reporters on Tuesday that he was expressing concern for Senate staff who must work on the floor, often nearby to where the presiding officer is seated.""Mitch McConnell has called senators back where all the staff has to come down to the Senate floor and be exposed. They have no choice, they lose their jobs or they come to work, like most of America,"" Brown said. Of the confrontation with Sullivan, Brown said, ""He was inches away from four people who had masks on, but couldn't protect themselves from him.""""I don't care what they say to me. I care about public health. It's clear that McConnell and some of my Senate colleagues, like Ted Cruz, care nothing about essential workers,"" Brown said. As the confrontation in the Senate continues to spark debate over mask wearing on Capitol Hill, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa tweeted Tuesday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, after his office had announced that morning that he had been exposed to the virus and would immediately quarantine. Grassley, who as president pro tempore is the most senior Republican in the chamber, is 87 years old, putting him at a vulnerable age for contracting the virus. The Iowa Republican spoke on the Senate floor on Monday and was seen at the Capitol speaking to reporters Monday afternoon.""I'm feeling good + will keep up on my work for the ppl of Iowa from home,"" he said in his tweet.Brown tweeted after the incident Monday, ""I asked my Republican colleagues to stop endangering all the Senate workers - and simply wear a mask when presiding over the Senate.""In his comments directed at Sullivan on the Senate floor, the Ohio Democrat pointed out that there are ""people below him,"" as he speaks. He went on to say, ""there clearly isn't much interest in this body in public health."" Since the pandemic has begun, there have been many occasions during which senators do not appear to be adequately socially distant on the Senate floor, especially during votes. A CNN review of hours of footage from September 29 through October 1 showed senators often crowding one another -- face-to-face and shoulder-to-shoulder -- and carrying on extended conversations in the chamber.This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.CNN's Ali Main, Caroline Kelly and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War make their onto next-gen consoles,"It's been a busy week in video games, as the long-awaited next-gen consoles from Xbox and PlayStation made their way to people's homes. While many gamers reported problems getting consoles before websites sold out of them, the lucky few who managed buy a console may be looking for new games to try.So it's hardly a surprise that the ""Call of Duty"" and ""Assassin's Creed"" franchises put out new releases this week. ""Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"" about Vikings and Norse mythology, debuted on November 10, the same day as the Xbox Series X. Three days later, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,"" set in the 1980s, was released.""Valhalla"" had twice as many active players on launch day as did Ubisoft's 2018 ""Assassin's Creed"" game, ""Odyssey,"" the company said in a press release, without providing specifics. The game features a new setting in England's Dark Ages, which Ubisoft said revives ""the age-old battle between Assassins and Templars the fans are familiar with."" It is the 13th main game in the franchise.A photo from ""Assassin's Creed Valhalla.""Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, said that relatively low competition around the holiday season will help ""Assassin's Creed Valhalla"" as will the game's mystical setting, which could appeal to fans of the franchise. He predicts that like previously successful ""Assassin's Creed"" titles, the game could sell 10 to 12 million copies, marking a solid hit for Ubisoft.""[It would be] as good as the best in their lineup,"" said Pachter, estimating that even the least successful titles tend to sell 7 million copies.Read MoreCall of Duty's ""Black Ops Cold War"" received a cooler reception among fans, who didn't buzz about the game online this week as much as they did for ""Valhalla."" ""Cold War"" drops players into Ronald Reagan's  America, where they are part of an elite team fighting the Vietnamese, the KGB and East German secret police. Both ""Cold War"" and ""Valhalla"" are playable on older consoles as well.Ronald Reagan in ""Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.""Reagan himself leads the American team as it undertakes secret assignments -- and as one character in the game puts it, ""every mission we go on is illegal."" ""Call of Duty"" is Activision's (ATVI) longtime cash cow, and the franchise recently celebrated the first anniversary of its mobile game and the continuing popularity of its free battle royale game, ""Warzone."" It remains to be seen if ""Cold War"" can achieve a similar level of success. Alex Giaimo, a Jefferies analyst, predicts that ""Call of Duty"" could be this holiday season's hit, and estimates sales for the game will top 20 million units per year. As for ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" and ""Valhalla,"" he added, ""both titles should do extraordinarily well [but] neither has the built-in audience that 'Call of Duty' has. ""We'd be shocked if they if they hit those types of level.""",2020-11-15T10:00:26Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/tech/valhalla-assassins-creed-call-of-duty/index.html,2020-11-16 11:37:51.609866,CNN,technology,0
Asia's economies are bouncing back. The West is headed in the other direction,"Asia's biggest economies have managed to escape prolonged fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Now they just have to make sure rising cases in the rest of the world don't put their recoveries in jeopardy.Japan reported Monday that its economy expanded 5% in the July-to-September quarter, allowing it to emerge from recession. That translated to an annual rate of expansion of 21.4%, the fastest pace on record for the world's third largest economy. Hours after Japan's announcement, China released data showing that its recovery is also continuing to pick up steam. Industrial production in the world's second-largest economy rose nearly 7% last month, beating estimates from economists polled by Refinitiv. Retail sales rose by slightly more than 4% — the fastest pace this year. China's economic recovery gains even more momentumThe promising news out of Asia stands in sharp contrast to the West, where many nations are grappling with a resurgence of Covid-19 and have been forced to once again impose restrictions in an attempt to bring their outbreaks under control. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated last Thursday that the US economy will need more stimulus from both the government and the central bank to get through the crisis.The Bank of England warned earlier this month of a douple-dip recession for the UK economy as the country re-entered national lockdown. The European Union is facing a similar fate.Read More""In large part because of a significantly better containment of the virus, most Asian economies are performing better than their Western counterparts,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics. He expected most major European economies to shrink this quarter because of new Covid-related restrictions. The United States may record a hit to its growth, too, even if the government there does not lock businesses down, he added. The challenge now in Asia is how to keep the momentum going, given the slowing growth among major trading partners. ""Lockdowns in Europe and a renewed slowdown in the US ... pose the risk that Asia's export recovery could take a breather,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economic Research and managing director at HSBC. He pointed out that Asian economies depend on global trade, and slow demand from the West could dent the recovery. ""Asia alone cannot pull the global economy out of its slump,"" he added. 'Center of gravity' shifting EastThe Chinese government on Monday acknowledged the risk posed by the continued prevalence of the pandemic elsewhere.Fu Linghui, a spokesman for China's National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters in Beijing that outbreaks in Europe and the United States have created uncertainties for China's exports. Still, he said that the total value of China's trade has increased this year, bucking the global trend.Kujis, of Oxford Economics, was also optimistic. Though weakness in the United States and Europe will weigh on trade and investment in Asia, he said, that shouldn't derail those economies entirely — as long as they can avoid new outbreaks of their own. (Daily Covid infections in Japan recently reached a three-month high, though the country's numbers are still well below those recorded in United States.)""If Asian economies can continue to avoid major new lockdowns, the impact of weakness in Europe and the US will only soften the continued recovery in Asia, not undo it,"" he said.Regardless of the state of the pandemic, countries in the region are also attempting to strengthen ties with each other, without the aid of the rest of the world. This weekend, China, Japan and more than a dozen other countries in Asia Pacific signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a major trade agreement that has been nearly a decade in the making.""It may reinforce a trend that's been already underway for decades: that the global center of economic gravity keeps pushing relentlessly to the East,"" wrote economists at HSBC in a research note released on Sunday.",2020-11-16T08:58:55Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/economy/asian-economies-japan-china-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-16 11:30:45.059860,CNN,world,0

Trump says for the first time Biden won the election but later insists he's not conceding,"President Donald Trump acknowledged for the first time on Sunday that Joe Biden won the presidential election, but the President refused to concede and blamed his loss on a string of conspiracy theories. Most news networks declared Biden the victor more than a week ago. Since the call was made, Biden has given a victory speech and gotten his transition team up and running. But Trump, who had questioned the validity of the election before votes had even been cast, is continuing to dig in his heels on unsupported legal challenges lodged by his allies over vote counts in several states and asserting that the fight has only begun. ""He won because the Election was Rigged,"" Trump said in one Sunday morning tweet. In another, he stood by his false belief he may be able to win the election and refused to concede, writing, ""I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go."" Trump also continued to blame his loss on debunked theories about the 2020 election in a series of posts flagged by Twitter for their disputed information. MAP: See 2020 election resultsRead MoreThe tweets from Trump followed a Saturday spent golfing and tweeting similar false conspiracy theories, and driving by a crowd of his supporters who gathered in Washington, DC, to protest the election results on the basis of his lies and propaganda.Since Biden declared victory last week, the President has spent little time in front of cameras and essentially no time answering questions from reporters he doesn't perceive as allies. But on Twitter this weekend, the President launched baseless conspiracy theories and false statements to his nearly 90 million followers online. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that his chance at a second term in office was stolen from him with corrupt votes. A previous fact check by CNN of claims by a handful of prominent Republicans, including members of Trump's family and supporters like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, of dead people voting in Michigan fell apart under scrutiny. A CNN analysis of the claim and the purported backing for it did not find a single instance of that happening.Biden TransitionBiden's toughest foreign policy challenge may be regaining allies' trustAs Trump refuses to concede, his agencies awkwardly prepare what they can for a Biden transitionAnalysis: Biden has a better shot at riding the economy up now than Obama didMAP: Full election resultsBiden reached more than 270 electoral votes after his win in Pennsylvania. The Democrat now has 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232 as a result of wins in two longtime Republican states, Arizona and Georgia, CNN projects -- far above the 270 threshold that Biden needed to clinch the presidency. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, said Sunday that he thinks the President is ""stunned"" by his loss. ""I think he's stunned by it. I think that's why he's been silent really for so long. He's lived in his own dream world and been successful at it these last four years,"" Bolton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""The coronavirus was one tragic reality that he couldn't deal with. His own election loss is, in his mind, another tragic reality now. So I think he's now trying to calibrate, if in fact I've lost, how do I maximize my brand in the days after the coming inauguration of Joe Biden? And I think that's what's at stake now.""Biden's incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said Sunday that Trump's tweet that the former vice president won is ""further confirmation of the reality,"" but added that the President's Twitter feed doesn't determine an election.""I accept it as a further confirmation of the reality that Joe Biden won the election -- and not through any of the rest of that tweet, not through fraud or anything else the President is baselessly alleging. He won because he got more votes, OK, that's why he won,"" Klain said during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He got more votes in the popular vote by a lot, and he won the same number of electoral votes that President Trump himself called a landslide four years ago. But look, if the President is prepared to begin to recognize that reality, that's positive. Donald Trump's Twitter feed doesn't make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that.""Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he is worried ""less and less"" about Trump trying to stay in power past January 20 because ""as more and more victories, state by state are confirmed for Biden, I think public support in any way, shape or form for the President is now going down.""However, Sanders told Tapper that it's ""beyond belief"" that the President ""continues to deny reality."" ""Trump will have the distinction of doing more than any person in the history of this country in undermining American democracy,"" Sanders added. ""The idea that he continues to tell his supporters that the only reason he may have lost this election is because of fraud is an absolutely disgraceful, un-American thing to do.""   And Ohio Republican Governor Mike DeWine told Tapper on the same program that though the President ""has every right to go into court,"" the Trump administration should begin the formal transition process for Biden's succession. ""It's clear, that certainly based on what we know now, that Joe Biden is the President-elect and that transition, for the country's sake, it's important for a normal transition to start through,"" DeWine said. ""And the President could go on his other track, his legal track. We should respect that, but we also need to begin that process.""This story has been updated with additional developments Sunday.

How a bloody night of bullets quashed a young protest movement ,"JUST WATCHEDCNN investigation sheds new light on anti-brutality protestReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN investigation sheds new light on anti-brutality protest 05:54'They pointed their guns at us and started shooting'By Stephanie Busari, Nima Elbagir, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Katie PolglaseVideo by Barbara Arvanitidis, Muhammad Darwish and Oscar FeatherstoneUpdated 0508 GMT (1308 HKT) November 18, 2020This story contains graphic imagery of injury and death. The full names of some interviewees and the identities of others have been withheld for their safety.


Sometime after midnight on October 21, Elisha Sunday Ibanga answered a phone call from his older brother's number.The person on the other end of the line -- a stranger -- broke the news that Ibanga's brother, Victor, had been shot dead at the Lekki toll gate, in Lagos, Nigeria, where he had been peacefully protesting against police brutality earlier that night.""The person told me that the police took his body away,"" Ibanga, 24, told CNN.An eyewitness to Victor Sunday Ibanga's death told CNN the 27-year-old entrepreneur was shot in the head during the protest. CNN has obtained and geolocated a photograph of Victor's body lying in a pool of blood and wrapped in the white and green of the Nigerian standard -- one of the same flags gripped by fellow protesters earlier in the evening as they sang the country's national anthem. Ibanga confirmed the photograph is of his brother.Read MoreThe body of Victor Sunday Ibanga is pictured in a pool of blood. The Ibangas are one of several families yet to locate the bodies of their missing loved ones -- protestors at the toll gate -- who dozens of eyewitnesses say were shot at, first by members of the Nigerian army and then hours later by police. Eyewitnesses told CNN they saw the army remove a number of bodies from the scene.What happened on October 20, and into the early hours of October 21, at the eight-lane Lekki toll gate -- a key piece of Lagos' road network -- has stunned the country.The protesters who were present have told CNN it was a ""massacre"" with multiple people killed and dozens wounded.  But local authorities have downplayed that account.Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, admitted to CNN that footage showed uniformed soldiers firing on peaceful protesters but claimed only two demonstrators were killed.  But, he then said there was ""not a scratch of blood"" at the toll gate when he visited. The governor said no families had approached authorities saying they were missing relatives.In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the army denied any involvement, describing reports of the incident as ""fake news,"" before backtracking and saying that soldiers were present but fired their weapons in the air and used blanks, not live rounds.CNN's calls to the Nigerian army have not been returned. But on November 14, during a judicial inquiry into the shooting, army representative Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo said, ""There's no way officers and men will kill their brothers and sisters. I repeat no way. We have those who constantly seek to drive a wedge between us and between the citizens of Nigeria...""The army also said at the hearing that it was the governor who called soldiers to the scene because the police were overrun. The governor has denied this, saying he does not have the authority to call in the army. The army has continued to restate that they did not fire live rounds.But an investigation by CNN into the disputed events has cast doubt on authorities' shifting and changing statements. Evidence of bullet casings from the scene match those used by the Nigerian army when shooting live rounds, according to current and former Nigerian military officials. Verified video footage -- using timestamps and data from the video files -- shows soldiers who appear to be shooting in the direction of protesters. And accounts from eyewitnesses establish that after the army withdrew, a second round of shooting happened later in the evening.Victor Sunday IbangaSince Elisha Sunday Ibanga learned of his brother's death, he has been visiting hospitals in a desperate search for his remains. ""My mother, my sisters, all my family are in prayer, just to see if we can find out and know where my brother's dead body is,"" he said. The bodies of other protesters are nowhere to be found.Peace Okon, 24, hasn't seen her younger brother Wisdom, 18, since he went to the protest the night of the shooting. Wisdom Okon""He just came back from work on that Tuesday, ate his food and went there,"" Okon told CNN.She started worrying when he didn't arrive home that night. By the next morning, Okon was out searching for him. ""I've gone to hospitals, I've gone to police stations, I've gone to everywhere. I can't find him,"" she said.Her brother had only moved to Lagos a few weeks before the protest -- Okon had helped him find a job as a cleaner at a bank. She says he didn't know anyone at the protest and had never been to one before.Okon said she wants the Nigerian authorities to tell her if her brother is alive and detained or dead.The shootings at Lekki toll gate followed weeks of ""#EndSARS"" protests against police brutality that had burst onto the streets of cities across Nigeria.For almost a fortnight, thousands of young Nigerians mostly under 30 -- a demographic that makes up 40% of the country's population -- protested, with calls for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a police unit widely and repeatedly accused of kidnapping, harassment and extortion.Police had agreed to disband the controversial unit but protests continued. It would be the fourth time it was being disbanded.    There were peaceful marches, candlelight vigils, multi-faith prayer sessions and DJ performances that attracted backing and solidarity from celebrities, the Nigerian diaspora and supporters around the world. The movement quickly widened beyond police brutality to other grievances -- capturing the frustrations of a young population demanding an end to bad governance in the oil-rich country.     Lekki, a relatively affluent suburb of Lagos, and the toll gate became a focal point of the movement.However, about 10 days into the protests, the demonstrations were hijacked by ""thugs and sponsored hoodlums"" who attacked protesters, causing deaths and injuries, according to Amnesty International Nigeria.  In response, on October 20, hours before the shooting, Governor Sanwo-Olu imposed a strict curfew starting at 4 p.m. following looting and vandalism in other parts of the state.It was later moved to 9 p.m. to allow commuters to get home. The timeline for when the curfew was imposed has become a point of contention between the Governor and the military. The army said their soldiers were unaware of the change to the later time, according to the army spokesperson's testimony to the eight-person judicial panel on November 14.For 24 hours, only essential service providers were to be allowed on the streets of the 20-million strong city.Demonstrators protest police brutality at the Lekki toll gate on October 20.Testimony from dozens of eyewitnesses and family members interviewed by CNN and a forensic examination of hours of video and dozens of photographs captured before, during and after the two shooting incidents show how a fledgling protest movement was all but extinguished by the very thing Nigerians were demonstrating against. Less than three hours after the original curfew time came into effect, army trucks left the Bonny Camp barracks on Victoria Island and headed towards the toll gate plaza and the protesters, according to videos reviewed by CNN.Two eyewitnesses told CNN they saw soldiers arriving in a Toyota Hilux pickup truck with ""OP Awatse"" written on it -- the name of a joint military task force that operates in Lagos State.Videos examined by CNN show the army trucks approaching the protesters from both sides of the toll gate -- barricading them in. DJ Switch, a local musician whose real name is Obianuju Catherine Udeh, was streaming live on Instagram when it all happened and the shooting began.   The shooting started almost immediately, with no warning given. Panic ensued as protesters attempted to flee.

""Please explain to me how, in which part of the world, do you go to a protest with live bullets.""
DJ Switch
""There was a guy that was running, and he just... he fell, and we looked at him. He was shot in the back,"" DJ Switch, 29, told CNN, as she tried to talk during an interview while crying.""Please explain to me how, in which part of the world, do you go to a protest with live bullets,"" she said.From multiple videos, CNN has pieced together a timeline that shows that shooting by the army lasted from 6:43 p.m. until at least 8:24 p.m., according to video evidence.The videos capturing some of those 101 minutes tell a story of terror and chaos. They show graphic injuries and people bleeding on the ground.One eyewitness, Sarah, whose last name we're not publishing for her safety, told CNN that the soldiers shot in the air but also directly at protesters.""They pointed their guns at us and they started shooting,"" she said. ""They were shooting in the air, they were shooting at us, they were shooting everywhere.""Some chanted: ""We are peaceful protesters"" and ""End Sars, we no go gree [pidgin for we will not agree, or give in].""""They're shooting, they're shooting,"" another person screams in one of the videos. Cries of ""Na lie, na lie [exclamations of disbelief in pidgin]"" can also be heard.In several of the videos, reviewed and verified by CNN, some of the protesters can be seen carrying bodies, the flashlights on their phones the only thing illuminating the darkness as the sound of ambulance sirens wail in the background. It is not known whether these were dead or injured protesters.In another, there are several injured people, some on the ground bleeding while defiant protesters continued to wave Nigerian flags.Injured people whom CNN has confirmed were present at the toll gate started arriving in local hospitals -- carried by civilians -- from 7:19 p.m. while the shooting was still ongoing, according to videos analyzed by CNN.One of the protesters, Mathew, pictured, says he was injured when the army opened fire at Lekki toll gate. Using metadata, CNN geolocated the image to the protest location at 6:50 pm.CNN has also seen and verified footage from one man who used his car as a makeshift ambulance and transported people to hospital.Separately, Dr. Ayo Aranmolate, executive medical director at Grandville medical center, told CNN he and his colleagues received around 15 injured people that night with various gunshot wounds and cuts. None of the people they treated died, he added.""We referred some for treatment to other hospitals,"" Dr. Aranmolate said. ""One of the victims had to have his leg amputated.""The army has denied that anyone was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds, and that they only shot into the air. Speaking in front of the judicial panel, the army spokesman Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo continued to deny that anyone was shot.Multiple eyewitnesses told CNN that ambulances were prevented from reaching the scene by the authorities.A video filmed at 8:49 p.m., according to metadata, shows ambulance workers in a van at the scene saying they are unable to get through.When contacted by CNN to share the findings of this investigation, a Lagos State government spokesman declined to comment. ""Talking about that subject now will be sub-judicial since the matter is already before a panel of inquiry. Until the panel concludes its investigation, the subject will not be open to any discussion or comment by any State official,"" the spokesperson said.Members of the judicial panel visit the Lekki toll gate on October 30.DJ Switch said she wanted people to see what was happening which is why she started broadcasting.""I didn't want anybody to come on and twist the story. I wanted people to see. So, I just went live.""At one point during the broadcast, there were attempts to resuscitate a man in red clothing who had passed out.Later, DJ Switch can be seen helping to extract a bullet lodged in another man's thigh as he screams in agony. Someone in the crowd says, ""you will live, you will not die.""As the live broadcast ends, people are still trying to apply CPR on the man in red, while DJ Switch can be heard saying, ""this guy is dying.""DJ Switch told CNN that protesters lifted bodies with bullet wounds and put them at the soldiers' feet.""I said, why are you killing us? Why are you doing this,"" she said. ""He expressly told me: 'I am acting on orders from above.'""CNN has examined bullet casings found at the scene and confirmed with current and former Nigerian military sources that the bullet casings match those used by the army. Two ballistics experts have also confirmed with CNN that the shape of the bullet casings indicate they used live rounds, which contradicts the army's claim they fired blanks.CNN has verified that bullets fired at Lekki toll gate are from live ammunition. This one was manufactured in Serbia in 2005, and is currently in use by the Nigerian army.And working with the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, CNN has established that several of the bullets from the Lekki toll gate originated from Serbia. Export documents CNN has seen show that Nigeria purchased weaponry from Serbia almost every year between 2005 and 2016.After the army withdrew from the scene, members of the police, including the SARS police unit -- disbanded by authorities on 11 October -- moved in, according to multiple eyewitnesses CNN spoke with.In a video obtained by CNN and geolocated to Lekki toll gate at 2:36 a.m., one eyewitness, Legend, whose second name we're not publishing for his safety, can be seen with the Nigerian flag around his head saying, ""...my hand is broken, my leg is broken, and police are still shooting at us."" 

""I couldn't count how many dead because I was running for my life.""
Legend
""They are shooting anything that moves outside...Stay safe through the night. And if I don't make it through the night let it be known that I died fighting for our freedom, for what we believe in.""Legend, who survived, told CNN his father was a police officer and that he recognized the SARS uniform. About 200 protesters remained at the toll gate when witnesses say police and SARS arrived, he added.""I couldn't count how many dead because I was running for my life,"" Legend said. ""If I stood my ground five more seconds, I would be dead.""While CNN has not been able to independently verify that SARS members were present, multiple eyewitnesses said they saw police officers, accompanied by officers from the unit, at the scene after the army left.A Lagos State police spokesman declined to comment because of the ongoing panel investigation. But police have denied any use of force against protesters on Twitter, saying, ""....our police officers never resorted to use of unlawful force or shooting at the protesters."" The widespread looting and damage that occurred across Lagos in the aftermath of the Lekki toll gate shooting has led to the authorities clamping down on people who took part in the protests.Workers clean up the Lekki toll gate on October 24.Many feel they are being scapegoated for taking part in peaceful protests -- wrongly blamed for the looting -- and fear has descended on the movement since the shooting.Moe Odele, a prominent lawyer who was giving legal advice to demonstrators arrested during the protests, says she was recently prevented from leaving the country after her passport was seized. Odele told CNN that her passport has since been returned.The country's central bank has obtained a 90-day court order freezing the accounts of those who took part in the demonstrations, according to media reports, while a journalist who covered the protests was arrested and detained for five days before being freed on bail. Several eyewitnesses have fled the country, while others are living in safe houses. Some told CNN they were offered money to recant their initial testimonies.CNN has seen some of the messages received, though it is unclear who is sending them.  ""We're hiding because our lives are in danger,"" an eyewitness named Sarah told CNN. ""We can't go out, our jobs are on hold right now, and it's really sad because we did nothing wrong.""""All we did was ask for change.""Edited by Blathnaid Healy.

How Brad Raffensperger became the most hated man in his party,"A week ago almost no one outside of Georgia had ever heard the name Brad Raffensperger. Today? He's the most hated man in Republican politics.Raffensperger is the secretary of state in Georgia, and as such, is in charge of the state's election. Which means that he is the lightning rod for President Donald Trump's ire about losing the state and ongoing pressure campaign to find a way to make sure that the full manual recount, which Raffensperger ordered last week, overturns the current result.""Georgia Secretary of State, a so-called Republican (RINO), won't let the people checking the ballots see the signatures for fraud,"" tweeted Trump on Friday. ""Why? Without this the whole process is very unfair and close to meaningless. Everyone knows that we won the state. Where is @BrianKempGA?"" (Trump has sent seven subsequent tweets attacking the Georgia recount process since that Friday tweet.)Georgia Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler called on Raffensperger to resign last week -- although they failed to mention exactly what he had done wrong. ""Georgians are outraged, and rightly so. We have been clear from the beginning: every legal vote cast should be counted. Any illegal vote must not. And there must be transparency and uniformity in the counting process,"" the two said in a joint statement.

And, as Raffenspgerger recounted to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, he was on the receiving end of a call from Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham that he perceived as pressuring him to disqualify ballots.Read More""He asked if the ballots could be matched back to the voters,"" Raffensperger said of Graham. ""And then he, I got the sense it implied that then you could throw those out for any, if you look at the counties with the highest frequent error of signatures. So that's the impression that I got.""(Sidebar: This is completely and totally outrageous on Graham's part -- especially given his role as the  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is in keeping, however, with his dogged willingness to win the award as Trump's most loyal sycophant. For what it's worth, Graham denied Raffenperger's allegation, calling it ""ridiculous."")That Raffensperger has somehow become the public face of Trumpworld's discontent with the outcome of the presidential election is, well, odd. Prior to running to be secretary of state in 2018, he served as a state representative from a suburban Atlanta seat. He won his current job in a December 2018 runoff against former Rep. John Barrow.In advance of that runoff victory, Raffensperger won the endorsement of -- wait for it -- President Donald Trump. ""Brad Raffensperger will be a fantastic Secretary of State for Georgia - will work closely with @BrianKempGA,"" tweeted the President on November 26, 2018. ""It is really important that you get out and vote for Brad - early voting starts today, election is on December 4th. @VoteBradRaff is tough on Crime and Borders, Loves our Military and Vets. He will be great for jobs!""The runoff (and the job) had drawn national attention even before Trump's endorsement because the man Raffensperger was running to replace, Brian Kemp, had just been elected governor by a very narrow margin over Democrat Stacey Abrams. Democrats cried foul that the chief election officer was also the GOP candidate for governor but Kemp refused to step down during the campaign. Those complaints grew louder amid the very close result -- Kemp won by fewer than 55,000 votes -- and Abrams refused to concede the race.Trump White HouseUS military anticipates Trump will issue order to plan for further troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and IraqTop Trump adviser moves closer to accepting Biden win: 'Obviously, things look that way now'Trump aims to undermine Biden's legitimacy even as legal challenges fizzleMAP: Full election resultsRaffensperger, despite the controversy, cast himself as a candidate who would follow in Kemp's footsteps particularly in regard to the state's strict voter ID law. ""I'm going to make sure that elections are clean, fair and accurate,"" he said in his victory speech. ""And that's the No. 1 priority as your next secretary of state.""Raffensperger could not have imagined then that less than two years after that win, he would be under fire from Republican not Democrats over his conduct in the 2020 election. But such is the irrational hold that Trump still exerts over the GOP. No one in the party really knows what they think Raffensperger did wrong. But they know Trump is mad, so they are mad too.For his part, Raffensperger isn't taking these intra-party attacks lying down. In response to the calls of Loeffler and Perdue for him to resign, he shot back: ""Let me start by saying that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me."" He also posted a series of debunkings of Trump's claims about voter fraud in the state on his Facebook page over the weekend.In his interview on CNN Monday night, Raffensperger reflected on what it has meant to see his own party turn against him.""You always think I'm on this side of the aisle obviously and you always think your side wears the white hats,"" he told Blitzer. ""But people are really upset about this. And at the end of the day, I understand how contentious it is. We're going to follow the process, we follow the law. The results will be what they are.""",2020-11-17T16:07:22Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/brad-raffensperger-donald-trump-loeffler-perdue-georgia-recount/index.html,2020-11-18 08:53:34.341159,CNN,politics,0

Boeing's 737 Max debacle could be the most expensive corporate blunder ever,"The 20-month grounding of the 737 Max could end as soon as this week, but Boeing's mounting costs have soared to tens of billions of dollars. That means the plane maker's repeated safety oversights and mismanagement were not only tragic but also rank among the expensive corporate mistakes in history.The two fatal crashes that led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max killed 346 people.    Financially, Boeing continues to pay a hefty cost to ensure the safety of future 737 Max passengers.Direct costsBoeing has detailed about $20 billion in direct costs from the grounding: $8.6 billion in compensation to customers for having their planes grounded, $5 billion for unusual costs of production, and $6.3 billion for increased costs of the 737 Max program.Read MoreThe company also spent nearly $600 million for jet storage, pilot training and software updates that are not included in the company's overall cost estimate. It also established a $100 million victim compensation fund, which is also not included in Boeing's $20 billion in estimated costs. So the costs of the grounding released by Boeing total $20.7 billion.Boeing's legal liability will almost certainly add to that cost. Published reports show that the families of the first 11 victims to settle with Boeing received at least $1.2 million each. That means the total cost is likely to top $500 million.Interest costs are adding up, too. Boeing borrowed billions of dollars at a roughly 5% interest rate to keep building 737 Max planes it can't deliver. The company built 450 Max jets during the grounding, but it hasn't delivered a single 737 Max plane in that nearly nearly two-year period. Only about half will be delivered next year, and some deliveries will stretch as far as 2023. Boeing doesn't get most of the money from a sale until the plane is delivered to the airline, so the interest will pile up — perhaps by about $3 billion or $4 billion, said Chris Denicolo, aerospace credit analyst with Standard & Poor's. What's clear is that the $20.7 billion in costs that Boeing has detailed is only the starting point. Bank of America puts the costs at more than $25 billion.""It's going to be more than $20 billion. But it's hard to say how much more it's going to be,"" said Denicolo.Lost salesIf financial damage from the 737 Max remains in the $20 billion range, that would not put it in the running for the most expensive mistake by a company. Volkswagen has spent €32 billion, or $38 billion, on its emissions cheating scandal. The most expensive mistake to date is the $68 billion cost to BP of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill of 2010.But BP lost little or no sales because of Deepwater Horizon, and VW suffered only a minor, short-term loss of sales from the emissions scandal. By contrast, it's clear that Boeing has suffered a huge loss in sales in the wake of the 737 Max grounding. Because of the grounding, Boeing lost the cancellation fees that had been written into in its sales contracts for 737 Max orders. As the Covid-19 pandemic sent air travel demand plummeting, airlines have begun taking advantage of the free cancellation policy, anticipating they won't need new planes for several years.The 737 Max is set to fly again soon. But Boeing's struggle is far from overBoeing had disclosed 448 canceled orders for the Max so far this year, compared with only nine for its other models. In addition it has dropped another 782 orders from its backlog of 737 Max orders because it believes those orders are no longer certain enough to rely on. In at least some cases those uncertain plane orders are jets airline customers have said they no longer want.A 737 Max typically sells for about $55 million, or half of the stated list price, so the worst-case scenario for Boeing is that it could lose as much as $67 billion in revenue from the drop in sales. But experts say it's more likely that Boeing will eventually sell those planes, though at a steep discount, in some cases to the same customers who are now canceling the orders.S&P's Denicolo and another industry expert agree that those steep discounts in sales price, which wouldn't have taken place if not for the grounding, are the real financial risk for Boeing. ""Say you're an airline. If there's no longer any penalty, why not cancel all my orders, and I can buy them back much cheaper?"" said the industry expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Boeing will not comment on the prices paid for its planes or any discounts. But the expert said it might be as much as a $20 million discount per plane, or roughly $25 billion total — more than doubling the true cost of the grounding. Discounting many of the 3,300 other Max orders still on the books could make Boeing's total cost of its 737 Max debacle climb even higher, perhaps past the $68 billion price tag of Deepwater Horizon.",2020-11-17T18:06:24Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/business/boeing-737-max-grounding-cost/index.html,2020-11-18 08:57:45.820502,CNN,financial,0
'The Crown' review: Season 4 tackles the Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher years,"The fourth season of ""The Crown"" is dominated by two women, and neither is the Queen. The stately Netflix drama rather pivots to the tragic tale of Princess Diana and the ascent of prime minister Margaret Thatcher, operating along those parallel tracks while as usual punctuating the narrative with signature events from British history.Thatcher -- who bore the nickname ""The Iron Lady"" -- is played by ""The X-Files"" star Gillian Anderson, the partner of series creator Peter Morgan. They deliver an extremely complex portrait, and Anderson so fastidiously captures the 1980s leader's carefully enunciated speech pattern that it's almost painful listening to her squeeze out words.That's actually the meatier part of the story -- capturing Thatcher's intense discomfort around the Royals, and her prickly interactions with Queen Elizabeth II (Olivia Colman) -- if not the showier and more commercial one. Of course, that hinges on Diana (Emma Corrin) and her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles (Josh O'Connor), who, despite pressure to settle down, never gets over his infatuation for Camilla Parker Bowles (Emerald Fennell).Morgan zeroes in on the dark side of Diana's fairy-tale story, as it's noted that Charles -- 12 years her senior to begin with -- acts old and stodgy for his age, while she acts younger. He's resentful of her popularity and appalled by her public displays, such as performing a surprise dance routine for his birthday.Diana's angst and pain is depicted in a number of ways, including an eating disorder, and her own extramarital dalliance as Charles stays away and rejects her. The key episode unfolds during the couple's whirlwind trip to Australia, a triumph for her and source of profound discomfort to him.Read MoreGillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher in 'The Crown' (Des Willie/Netflix)Yet for those fascinated by the levers of power, Thatcher's arc possesses more heft, including the misogyny that she faced, and her harsh approach to other women despite those dynamics.""The way those men patronize me,"" she fumes to her husband, while leading England into war in the Falklands and resisting efforts to sanction the South African government.The Royal Family doesn't exactly take a back seat over the 10 episodes, perhaps because Colman and the rest of the core cast remain fabulous, including an episode where an intruder improbably finds his way into the palace. In the ""Oh, to be a fly on the wall"" department, Morgan fills in the gaps.The Queen even finds herself second-guessing her parenting skills, given how the now-grown children have turned out, a subplot that takes on a slightly different meaning in light of questions surrounding Prince Andrew's relationship with accused sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.The new season starts out a bit slowly, but the action quickly picks up. All told, the show remains an utterly enjoyable binge, even if the latest season doesn't quite measure up to the previous ones -- a byproduct of the years and conflicts encompassed.While this material encompasses what's perhaps the most media-friendly period in terms of subject matter, the emphasis on Diana and Charles can't help but feel more People magazine-ish, and thus less revelatory. (By contrast, the earlier struggles of Princess Margaret, played by Helena Bonham Carter last season, were a highlight, and her role is diminished.)That quibble doesn't significantly detract from the show's status as one of Netflix's -- and indeed TV's -- best. Like everything else associated with the much-examined lives of the Royals, chalk it up as another high-class problem.""The Crown"" premieres Nov. 15 on Netflix.",2020-11-10T21:52:39Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/10/entertainment/the-crown-season-4-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:13:41.590888,CNN,entertainment,0
Georgia secretary of state says Lindsey Graham implied he should try to throw away ballots,"Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood firm Monday on his account that Sen. Lindsey Graham had hinted that he should try to discard some ballots in Georgia, where a recount is underway after the state went for President-elect Joe Biden in the presidential election.""He asked if the ballots could be matched back to the voters,"" Raffensperger told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" Monday evening. ""And then he, I got the sense it implied that then you could throw those out for any, if you look at the counties with the highest frequent error of signatures. So that's the impression that I got.""He later added, ""It was just an implication of, 'Look hard and see how many ballots you could throw out.' ""  Raffensperger's comments come after he told The Washington Post on Monday that Graham had cast doubt on Georgia's signature-matching law in a conversation on Friday, and had also floated the possibility that biased poll workers could have counted ballots with inconsistent signatures. Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also inquired if Raffensperger could discard all mail-in ballots from counties that had shown higher rates of unmatched signatures, the Republican secretary of state told the Post on Monday.Read MoreThere has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, and fraudulently altering a federal election vote tally is a federal crime.Graham denied Raffensperger's claim on Monday, telling CNN that he had said he wanted to understand the process for verifying the signatures on mail-in ballots. He said President Donald Trump did not urge him to make the call.Asked if he was trying to pressure the secretary of state to toss legal ballots, Graham said, ""That's ridiculous.""""What I'm trying to find out was how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention? So like when you mail in a ballot, you got to have some way to verify that the signature on the envelope actually matches the person who requested the ballot,"" Graham said. ""It seems to me that Georgia has some protections that maybe other states don't have, where you go into the portal to get your ballot. But I thought it was a good conversation. I'm surprised to hear him verify it that way.""Graham added: ""So they expanded mail-in voting, and how you verify the signatures to me is the big issue. If you're going to have mail-in voting, you've got to verify that the person who signed the envelope is also the person who requested the ballot.""Raffensperger told Blitzer that Georgia's election systems already require signature matches when voters request mail ballots and when completed ballots are returned to election systems. He also said the online absentee portal has a photo ID. ""We feel confident the election officials did their job,"" he said.  On Friday, CNN projected that Biden will win Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. Unofficial results put Biden ahead of Trump by about 14,000 votes, or about 0.3 percentage point. But due to the tight margin, state officials decided to use the preplanned audit process to recount every ballot in the presidential race. At least six small counties in Georgia have finished their presidential recounts without finding any discrepancies. A seventh county, Floyd, reported that 2,600 uncounted ballots had been found during their recount -- the ballots hadn't been scanned when the county tallied its early vote. An investigation is underway but human error has been deemed responsible.Experts say it would be nearly impossible for Trump to overcome his 14,000-vote deficit in a recount. The audit process is expected to conclude in the coming days, and Raffensperger reiterated Monday that he plans to certify the official results by Friday, as required by state law.""We want to make sure this vote is very accurate. We understand the national importance of this, and we're in the process of doing it,"" he told Blitzer on Monday. ""The counters will be done by the 18th and we will certify this by the 20th."" The Republican spent part of his Sunday fact-checking Trump and pushing back against false claims of fraud in the presidential election and the hand recount ongoing in the state.  Raffensperger, among other things, defended the integrity of absentee ballots, signature verification, and the vote counting machines. He posted images of Trump's tweets that falsely claimed that mail-in voting ""will lead to the most corrupt election in USA history"" and result in ""fraudulent ballots."" Raffensperger responded that his team ""secured and strengthened absentee ballots for the first time since 2005"" by outlawing absentee ballot harvesting and also addressed the ""disinformation about signature match,"" writing that ""GBI trained elections officials match your signature twice before any vote is cast."" He also posted links to news articles debunking Trump's tweets, including one alleging the Dominion voting software used in Georgia for the presidential election ""deleted"" and ""switched"" millions of votes. He also wrote, ""Dominion voting system. America owned. America. 'Merica. Not Venezuela,"" in a reference to conspiracy theories spread by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Guiliani.Underscoring the contentious atmosphere between Raffensperger and fellow Republicans, he went after US Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, in one post writing, ""Failed candidate Doug Collins is a liar — but what's new?"" Collins is leading the recount team for Trump in Georgia and has criticized Raffensperger's handling of the election.CNN's Amara Walker and Jason Morris contributed to this report.",2020-11-17T02:12:42Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/politics/georgia-secretary-of-state-lindsey-graham-ballots-cnntv/index.html,2020-11-17 10:27:25.410179,CNN,politics,0

"Biden urges Congress to pass coronavirus package with state, local government funding","President-elect Joe Biden warned that President Donald Trump's unwillingness to accept the outcome of the 2020 election could hamper the incoming Biden administration's ability to rapidly distribute a coronavirus vaccine. ""More people may die if we don't coordinate,"" Biden told reporters Monday in Delaware, in a news conference after he met with labor and business leaders and delivered a speech on the economy.Biden's comment comes as Trump refuses to acknowledge the reality that he lost the presidential election. The Trump-appointed administrator of the General Services Administration has so far refused to take the legally necessary step to begin the transition process, which would give Biden's team a budget, intelligence briefings and access to federal agencies.

""I am hopeful that the President will be mildly more enlightened before we get to January 20,"" he said, making note of the date he will be inaugurated.Read MoreBiden criticized Trump for failing to work with Congress to negotiate a measure to aid businesses and unemployed Americans as the pandemic rages heading into the winter.""The idea the President is still playing golf and not doing anything about it is beyond my comprehension,"" Biden said.His speech came the same day as news that early data shows Moderna's coronavirus vaccine is 94.5% effective -- and a week after early data showed Pfizer's vaccine is 90% effective. Biden praised Republican governors who have required their states' citizens to wear masks, singling out North Dakota's Doug Burgum, Utah's Gary Herbert and Ohio's Mike DeWine.And he lambasted Trump's coronavirus adviser, Scott Atlas, for urging people on Twitter to ""rise up"" against governors' mask mandates. ""What the hell's the matter with these guys? What is the matter with them? Resist?"" Biden said. ""Every major individual of any consequence in the health field is saying we can save"" lives through mask mandates.Holding up the mask he had worn to the podium where he delivered his speech Monday, Biden said: ""Does anybody understand why a governor would turn this into a political statement? It's about patriotism."" Biden characterized the economy as ""teetering on the edge"" headed into a ""very dark winter"" months before coronavirus vaccines could become widely available.He urged Congress to pass a coronavirus relief package that includes funding to help state and local governments with payrolls for public workers like teachers and first responders. ""There's a reason why the federal government is able to run a deficit: because the states must, must, balance their budget. And they're in real trouble,"" Biden said.He called on the Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate to pass a package similar to legislation the House approved months ago -- but that the Senate has refused to take up.

""They want us to cooperate,"" he said.Biden's remarks Monday followed a virtual meeting he and Harris held with the heads of several of the nation's leading labor unions and the top executives of Microsoft, General Motors, Gap and Target. ""I must tell you, it reinforced what I thought from the beginning: We're ready to come together. And the unity was astounding,"" Biden said of the meeting. ""It was really encouraging, quite frankly, to get people -- business and labor -- together agreeing on the way forward.""He is set to take office -- much like he did as vice president in 2008 -- with a battered economy, this time the result of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden campaigned on a push for hundreds of billions of dollars in stimulus spending aimed at clean energy, infrastructure and what he called the ""caregiving economy.""Biden pitched that plan Monday afternoon, calling them the kinds of investments that could strengthen the United States economy and create millions of union jobs. He also said he wants a $15-per-hour minimum wage nationwide.""The road ahead, it will not be easy.

Several sheriffs in upstate New York say they will ignore Gov. Cuomo's order to limit Thanksgiving guests,"Less than a week after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo instilled an executive order limiting the number of people at Thanksgiving gatherings, several upstate sheriffs say they plan to ignore it.Cuomo's order limits the number of people New York residents can have in their private homes to 10. ""New York follows the science. We know indoor gatherings and parties are a major source of COVID spread. To slow the spread, NYS will limit indoor gatherings at private residences to 10 people. This limit takes effect Friday at 10pm,"" he tweeted on November 11. Two days later, sheriffs around Albany started speaking against the measure. Fulton County sheriff explains his position to CNNRead MoreFulton County Sherriff Richard Giardino, who wrote one of the news releases, explained to CNN's Brianna Keilar why he is also not going to enforce Cuomo's order. ""I don't think the Constitution allows for the infringement on the number of people in your own home,"" he said. ""He has authority to do a lot but not to tell law enforcement to get into someone's house and count who is there.""My position as a sheriff is that I took the same oath the governor did... and I don't take any issue with the governors intent... to do what is best under the circumstances, but as a constitutional officer I have an obligation to the constituents in my county to follow that law,"" he said.Giardino wrote the post after he spoke to a veteran concerned about getting his son in trouble over a holiday visit. Giardino said Cuomo's order doesn't allow police to fine or arrest anyone.""What I'm saying is, it sends a chill into my community that law enforcement is going to knock on their door, count the number of people, and arrest them."" Other counties echo the same sentimentsTwo other sheriffs shared similar feelings on their departments' Facebook pages. ""I have no plans to utilize my office's resources or Deputies to break up the great tradition of Thanksgiving dinner,"" Erie County Sheriff Timothy B. Howard said Monday. ""My office will respect the sanctity of your home and traditions, and I encourage you to follow your heart and act responsibly, as well as do what's best for your family.""Likewise, Saratoga County Sheriff Michael Zurlo questioned how it would be a good use of employees. ""I can't see how devoting our resources to counting cars in citizens' driveways or investigating how much turkey and dressing they've purchased is for the public good,"" he said in a press release.The release said the department' does not agree that government can decide how many guests someone may have for Thanksgiving. The statement urged everyone to follow guidelines and stay home if sick. ""I encourage everyone to act responsibly,"" Zurlo concluded. Cuomo's office commented on the responses. ""Politicians acting like politicians and ignoring what the actual experts say has been fueling the spread of this virus and is what plunged this country into this continued public health crisis in the first place. ‎We urge everyone to continue to be smart and act responsibly. We know this makes people unhappy, but better unhappy then sick or worse,"" Rich Azzopardi, the governor's senior adviser, said in a statement to CNN.

'B Positive' review: CBS' kidney-transplant comedy earns mildly passing grades,"The latest series from sitcom maestro Chuck Lorre, ""B Positive,"" owes debts to two of his earlier hits: ""Dharma & Greg"" and ""The Big Bang Theory."" Yet this conventional sitcom benefits most from its casting, pairing ""Silicon Valley's"" Thomas Middleditch and Annaleigh Ashford as the mismatched duo united by the former's need for a kidney.That predicament was a personal one to series creator Marco Pennette, a transplant recipient, which explains the origins of a concept that's sort of the opposite of ""meet-cute."" But it's primarily a predictable excuse to throw together an odd couple that wouldn't hang out otherwise -- him a tightly wound, newly divorced therapist, her the boozy, free-spirited ""train wreck"" he remembers from high school.The two run into each other at a wedding, not long after Middleditch's Drew has learned that he's going to need a transplant. When he explains his plight to former classmate Gina (Ashford, whose credits include ""Masters of Sex""), she impulsively offers to become his donor, after reminding him that he's ""the one guy I didn't hook up with in high school.""Lorre has almost single-handedly kept the traditional multi-camera sitcom alive (other current CBS shows including ""Mom"" and ""Bob Hearts Abishola""), and ""B Positive"" should receive a lift from airing behind the producer's ""Big Bang"" spinoff ""Young Sheldon,"" which, despite its popularity, qualifies as one of TV's most unsung comedies.That bodes reasonably well for ""B Positive"" at least getting sampled, and viewers might be eager for a comedic distraction after days of election drama, which doesn't mean they'll be inclined to stick around.Read MoreThe leads do provide good company, even though the tension between them feels better suited to a movie rom-com than this sort of open-ended engagement. On the down side, a second episode -- in which Drew goes to dialysis and makes some eccentric new friends -- already starts to feel a tad stale.Of course, sustaining a premise represents a familiar challenge for new broadcast series, and the question is whether the procedure will take or will be rejected by viewers. Thanks to its stars, ""B Positive"" earns mildly favorable scores at the outset, even if the title, as sitcom grades go, would be a bit too positive.""B Positive"" premieres November 5 at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS.",2020-11-05T19:11:56Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/05/entertainment/b-positive-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:19:36.552513,CNN,entertainment,0

Walmart will start counting customers again as coronavirus cases reach record levels,"Walmart has resumed counting and monitoring the number of customers that enter and leave it stores. This comes as coronavirus cases in the United States hit daily highs. In April, the company began restricting the number of people to 20% of its store capacity, or lower if mandated by local officials. But for a brief period of the time, its stores stopped counting the number of customers that entered it stores.""We know from months of metering data in our stores that the vast majority of the time our stores didn't reach our self-imposed 20% metering capacity,"" said Kory Lundberg, a Walmart (WMT) spokesperson. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we have resumed counting the number of people entering and leaving our stores."" Like other retailers, Walmart is spreading Black Friday sales over time to limit the number of people in stores during the holiday shopping season. Walmart's Black Friday deals will last three weekends, which will begin on its website before hitting stores a few days later. ""Black Friday Deals for Days"" encompassed the first and second weekends of November and will include the fourth weekend too, with the deals appearing online Wednesdays.Read MoreAlthough it's pushing people to shop online and use its curbside pickup option, shoppers that go to its stores won't experience the pandemonium of the past. Instead, they will form single-file lines at the entrance and be given sanitized shopping carts. ""Health Ambassadors"" will be stationed at entrances to remind people to put on their masks. Social distancing will be enforced inside with capacity controls and one-way lanes.Walmart said the changes at its stores ""will be safer and more manageable for both our customers and our associates.""With the holiday season fast approaching and the weather getting colder, more shoppers are looking to stock up for the winter season ahead. Nearly 60% of shoppers say they plan to stock up again as winter approaches, according to a survey of 1,000 shoppers by market research firm Inmar Intelligence conducted during the week of October 14.Other grocery store chains, such as Kroger (KR) and Giant, have begun reinstating purchase limits on items, such as toilet paper, paper towels and disinfecting wipes. The moves come as grocery stores look to prevent shoppers from hoarding and ""panic buying"" -- like before when the pandemic first hit in the spring. Coronavirus cases have surged to record levels in the US, with more than 45 states reporting new infections this week than the week prior, according to data from John Hopkins University. So far, there have been at least 10,962,835 cases of coronavirus in the United States and at least 245,933 deaths. Many states have also begin setting stricter measures to stop the spread of the virus, including scaling back indoor dining and banning services for nonessential businesses. -- CNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.

Dominic Thiem beats Rafael Nadal in an extraordinary match at the ATP Finals ,"Dominic Thiem beat Rafael Nadal in straight sets to continue his unbeaten campaign at this year's ATP Finals. Both men helped deliver an exhilarating match with the Austrian emerging victorious from the high-quality affair after winning two tiebreakers -- 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-4). It's just a shame no fans were in the arena to witness the encounter, with matches being played behind closed doors at the O2 Arena in London amid the pandemic. Those watching from home were treated to a true spectacle though -- the opening set alone lasted one hour and 12 minutes with both men making just 19 unforced errors between them. ""It was a great match from the first to the last point. I was pretty lucky to get the first set,"" Thiem said after the match.Read More""I knew I had a slight advantage when I won the first set but I had to stay super focused. The atmosphere would have been unreal today I guess, but I hope that we put a very good show on for all the people who watched on TV.""It's very tough times at the moment, strict lockdowns in most of the countries as well as in Austria since today. ""So I really hope people enjoyed the match back home and they forgot a little bit for two hours, 30 minutes the tough times we're living through right now.""As of November 17, Austria is entering stricter lockdown measures with people only allowed to leave their homes for a specific reason, such as going to work, shopping for basic goods, and for medical appointments. Bars, pubs and restaurants are now closed along with schools, with teaching being done remotely. The new measures are scheduled to run until December 6, says the interior ministry.READ: Medvedev hits underarm serve on his way to victory against ZverevRafael Nadal could barely have played better in the loss. Thiem progressesThiem faced two set points in an intense opening set which saw both men push each other to their very best tennis. It was the Austrian who held his nerve in the tiebreaker though, slapping a wonderful forehand across the court to take the lead in the match.Nadal, who brushed aside Andrey Rublev 6-3 6-4 in his opening match, could barely have played better and the levels didn't drop at the start of an extraordinary second set.The Spaniard's form did temporarily abandon him when serving to stay in the match though, after he made three uncharacteristic mistakes which handed Thiem three match points.However, the 20-time grand slam champion pulled off a stunning escape to stay in the encounter and eventually force a tiebreak, with Thiem once again edging it. ""I think it's important that we players who are privileged to do our job, give all the people who are not that privileged a great time,"" Thiem added.The reigning US Open champion progresses to the semifinals of the tournament with one game to spare after Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Rublev 6-1 4-6 7-6 (8-6) later on Tuesday.

"'Grey's Anatomy' powered his ambitions. Now, this doctor is helping the show tackle coronavirus","Naser Alazari was a 24-year-old unemployed physician living in Syria, having been displaced from his home country of Iraq by war, when the words of Meredith Grey first hit his ears and touched his heart. ""I have to tell you, episode one, I watched it and the voice of Ellen Pompeo [as] Meredith Grey...it was like an aria. It was a solemn aria about life and death,"" he recalled via phone recently. When his sister, Safa Alazari, now an aspiring architect, handed him DVD sets for the first three seasons of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" he had initially resisted her efforts to get him to watch the show about doctors in the United States. Now 36 and a senior surgical adviser for the series, he's grateful for his sister's insistence. And, it is likely, so is ""Grey's Anatomy"" because Alazari's first-hand experience of working during the current global health pandemic is helping power a season unlike any other.""I was a proponent of starting in a universe of Covid because I feel our show has such an incredible accessibility to people and relatability to people that we need to be there with them,"" Alazari said. ""We're going to share your frustration. We're going to share your loss...and also, who knows, maybe we'll be there with you when this is over.""Naser Alazari, right, with his sister Safa Alazari, who introduced him to 'Grey's Anatomy.' Read MoreIf there's a reason to share Alazari's sense of hope, it's that he's someone who knows a lot about the wonderful twists life can deliver after a period of struggle. How to save a lifeBorn and raised in Iraq, Alazari knew he wanted to become a doctor when he was young -- around 18. Having lived through multiple wars, he says he felt a sense of ""obligation"" to be a helper in a world of human suffering, poverty and illness (his father died of pancreatic cancer).""I wanted to understand more about this science that is fascinating. It's so empowering,"" he said. ""But I didn't understand the impact of it back then -- to be able to change people's lives."" ""Grey's Anatomy"" opened his eyes in many ways in 2007. Naser Alazari, right, is photographed with his brother, Sayf, while living in Iraq. He'd gone to the school of medicine at Al-Nahrain University in Baghdad, but upon watching the show, decided to work hard so he could practice medicine in the United States. He said he was drawn to the cutting-edge technology in biotech, surgical advancements, access to new pharmaceuticals and other systems that empower doctors to offer higher quality care. (He is, however, critical of the inflated charges that have ""interrupted and challenged affordability and accessibility."") ""Remember, I lived in Iraq during the stern embargo years, when UN Sanctions limited medical supply access to the country which traumatized our health care system there,"" he said. ""That, alongside corruption, [and] we were left with a dysfunctional health care in that country."" Five years into his time in the US, then a general surgery resident, he received an email soliciting applications for a program created by Dr. Zoanne Clack, a ""Grey's Anatomy"" executive producer and ER doctor. Those selected for the Grey's Anatomy Surgical Communication Fellowship would serve as consultants for a period of time and help the writers guide the direction of the medical stories told on the show.""I remember I said, 'There's no way they're going to take me. This show really got me to this point. There's no way life is so good that it's taking you back to the show,'"" he said. Life was that good. Essential entertainmentSeven years later, ""good"" isn't the word most would use to describe 2020. Particularly recalling the early days of the pandemic, Alazari called his experience ""dystopian."" For the past three years, he's been practicing medicine while also working in the writer's room to help keep his skills sharp. 'Grey's Anatomy' will tackle coronavirus in its new season. Pictured are Jake Borelli and Chandra Wilson.In March, when ""Grey's Anatomy"" was shuttered like other productions, he began putting in even more hours at Reliant Immediate Care, which provides occupational health and urgent care in Los Angeles.  Early on, when little was known about coronavirus or its transmission, frustration mounted for him and other medical professionals as they dealt with having no protocols, personal protective equipment or tests for those who came in with the tell-tale flu-like symptoms. That time was all about improvisation, he remembered. ""But, in the end, I've been there before, as you know,"" he said. ""For me, it was eerily very reminiscent of my wars back in Iraq. Like, I felt this was a war zone. This is the first time I'd seen America in such a way -- where you feel that people are scared, the enemy is invisible, we don't have enough information of what this is and we don't have resources for this."" Still, he felt it was important to meet the need for doctors, even if there was, at times, little they could provide in the way of answers. ""I felt this was a calling for me as a doctor, and I guarantee you, a lot of doctors and nurses felt the same way -- that we have to be there for our people,"" he said. ""It's incumbent upon me to be a voice of reason and science and reassurance to everybody that I can get access to."" Even with the weight of the task, he said, ""it absolutely was an honor to be of service."" There was a brief moment when ""Grey's Anatomy"" showrunner Krista Vernoff considered not tackling the pandemic on the show. In a panel last month, she said Alazari was one of the people who talked her out of it. ""We didn't want to retell the story of Covid as much as make Covid the universe that we're living in,"" he said. ""We will preserve the spirit of 'Grey's Anatomy' as it is, and at the same time, be present for telling stories about the pandemic."" Dr. Naser Alazari, second from left, and other members of the medical team from ""Grey's Anatomy"" accept a Sentinel Award for an episode of the series that tackled maternal mortality. Also pictured from left is Dr. Kavita Vakharia, Dr. Zoanne Clack and Dr. Michael Metzner.As a show that has earned praise for its handling of and storylines about many medical issues and topics -- including maternal mortality, sexual assault and human trafficking -- they will tackle coronavirus with a sense of responsibility.They have to walk a ""thin line,"" Alazari said. They want to provide up-to-date information but not, say, advocate for an unproven treatment of some kind. For that and other reasons, Alazari, an essential worker himself, sees television as essential in his own right at this time. ""I'm seeing how the set has transformed, and what the cast and crew has to go through in order to produce these episodes is really heroic, in my opinion,"" he said. ""In the end, you're creating this entertainment to go back to the homes of these people who have been watching the show for 17 years because you want to be there with them.""

Diego Maradona discharged from clinic following successful brain surgery,"Diego Maradona was discharged from the Olivos clinic in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Wednesday. Maradona, who turned 60 on October 30, had surgery for a blood clot on his brain last week and the subdural hematoma surgery was successful, according to his doctor Leopoldo Luque.The former footballer is now under outpatient medical care and will be supervised by a new interdisciplinary team, Luque said.Luque also said last week that Maradona had been displaying withdrawal symptoms -- including a ""sweating reaction"" and ""at one point anger"" -- that were ""mainly due to consumption ... throughout his life.""A subdural hematoma is considered ""among the deadliest of all head injuries,"" according to the US National Library of Medicine.Read MoreIt is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura.

"Meet Rebekah Mercer, the deep-pocketed co-founder of Parler, a controversial conservative social network","Rebekah Mercer, a prominent conservative donor, revealed Saturday that she is helping to bankroll Parler, the rapidly growing but controversial conservative social media platform that was at the top of App Store charts last week.Mercer is the daughter of Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager and the co-founder of the now-defunct political data-analysis firm Cambridge Analytica. The Mercers have been prominent supporters of President Donald Trump and conservative causes.""John and I started Parler to provide a neutral platform for free speech, as our founders intended, and also to create a social media environment that would protect data privacy,"" Mercer said in a statement on the platform. ""The ever increasing tyranny and hubris of our tech overlords demands that someone lead the fight against data mining, and for the protection of free speech online. That someone is Parler, a beacon to all who value their liberty, free speech, and personal privacy.""What is Parler?The social media website ParlerParler, founded in 2018 by Mercer, John Matze and Jared Thomson, bills itself as ""unbiased social media"" and a place where people can ""speak freely and express yourself openly without fear of being 'deplatformed' for your views,"" according to its website and App Store description. It looks like a mashup of Twitter and Instagram, with its main feed, follower counts and ways to share posts and links. Read MoreThe platform became the most-downloaded free app in the Apple App Store on the weekend of November 8 -- the day major media outlets called the election for Joe Biden.Parler mostly attracts conservative users. Some of Parler's most-active users include Fox News host Sean Hannity, radio personality Mark Levin, far-right activist Laura Loomer, Senator Ted Cruz and Congressman Devin Nunes. Eric Trump and Donald Trump's presidential campaign also have accounts on the platform.A substantial number of users have followed these voices onto the platform, fueled by complaints over actions major social media platforms have taken against election misinformation and false allegations of voter fraud, such as disputing claims with fact-check labels. Twitter (TWTR), more than Facebook (FB), took aggressive action on many of President Trump's tweets during the election. At one point, the social network applied warning labels to more than a third of Trump's tweets after polls closed. Some of Trump's tweets were hidden behind a warning label which users had to click through before being able to read what they said.With big tech companies flagging false information, Parler has become a free-for-all for conservative voices. According to an ADL report released on Thursday, members of the Proud Boys, adherents of conspiracy theory QAnon, anti-government extremists and white supremacists all openly promote their views on Parler. ""Holocaust denial, antisemitism, racism and other forms of bigotry are also easy to find,"" the ADL said.Who is Rebekah Mercer?Rebekah Mercer in 2017 For years, the Mercers have been key benefactors of conservative groups, ranging from the Heritage Foundation think tank, where Rebekah Mercer serves on the board of trustees, to organizations that have produced anti-Hillary-Clinton books and movies.But the family emerged in national politics in the 2016 election cycle when Robert Mercer, who helped oversee Renaissance Technologies hedge fund, and his wife Diane, donated more than $23 million to groups that backed conservative candidates, according to a tally by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. In that election, the Mercers financed a super PAC that initially backed Texas Senator Ted Cruz's bid for the Republican presidential nomination before throwing its support behind Trump.The media-shy Rebekah Mercer is widely reported to have persuaded then-candidate Trump to reshuffle his campaign organization and hire Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway to help run his presidential bid in the final stretch of the 2016 election.

New York Times: Trump asked advisers about possible strike on Iranian nuclear site,"President Donald Trump last week asked senior aides what possibilities he had for an offensive strike on Iran's primary nuclear site, The New York Times reported Monday.Citing four current and former US officials, the paper reported that the meeting occurred in the Oval Office on Thursday. A day before, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report obtained by the Times stating that Iran's stockpiles of uranium had reached 12 times the 300-kilogram limit set in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the landmark nuclear deal Iran signed with the United States and five other nations in 2015. Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018.CNN has reached out to the agency for a copy of the report.Trump asked his highest-ranking national security advisers what possible responses were available to him and how best to respond to Iran, officials told the Times.Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley were among the senior advisers who convinced the President not to pursue a military strike, according to the paper. They cautioned that such an attack could easily balloon into a full-fledged confrontation in his final days as president, the Times reported.Read MoreAdministration officials with knowledge of the meeting told the paper that after Pompeo and Milley hammered home the threat of the attack mushrooming into a larger conflict, officials departed the meeting thinking that the possibility of a missile attack on Iranian soil was no longer in question.But officials told the paper that Trump could be continuing to eye plans to attack Iranian allies and assets, such as militias in Iraq.Trump withdrew from the Iran deal and re-introduced economic sanctions in 2018. Iran announced a partial withdrawal from the deal in May 2019, and that July the Iranian government announced that Tehran had begun to increase uranium enrichment beyond the purity threshold it agreed to as part of a landmark nuclear deal.CNN's Ivana Kottasová, Parmida Mahalli, Nick Paton Walsh and Tamara Qiblawi contributed to this report.",2020-11-17T02:54:17Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/politics/trump-possible-offensive-iran-nuclear-site/index.html,2020-11-17 10:28:33.948855,CNN,politics,0

"Lewis Hamilton: 'I have walked this sport alone,' says F1 champion after record-equaling title win ","Lewis Hamilton may be Formula One's most successful driver but after securing a record-equaling seventh world title on Sunday the Briton said he still had plenty left to achieve -- namely making his sport and the world ""more diverse and inclusive."" A brilliant drive during a rain-soaked Turkish Grand Prix ensured Hamilton not only won the race -- for a record-extending 94th Grand Prix victory -- but also equaled Michael Schumacher's tally of seven world titles, the one remaining record of the German great that the Englishman has not yet surpassed.Lewis Hamilton equals Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titlesIn an Instagram post after his historic feat, Hamilton said the coronavirus pandemic had given him a chance to ""really think about my ultimate purpose.""""Seven World Championships means the world to me, I can't even describe how much, but there's still another race we've yet to win,"" the post read. ""This year I've been driven not just by my desire to win on the track, but by a desire to help push our sport, and our world to become more diverse and inclusive. I promise you I am not going to stop fighting for change. We have a long way to go but I will continue to push for equality within our sport, and within the greater world we live in.Read More""Equaling Michael Schumacher's record puts a spotlight on me that I know won't be here forever. So, while you're here, paying attention, I want to ask everyone to do their part in helping to create a more equal world. Let's be more accepting and kinder to each other. Let's make it so that opportunity is not something that is dependent on background or skin colour.""Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the Turkish Grand Prix.No driver in the sport's history has won as many races, secured as many pole positions or finished on the podium as many times as Hamilton. He is widely expected to add to his tally of world titles -- saying on the podium after the race that he felt ""like I'm only just getting started"" -- and his place in F1's pantheon has long since been assured. He is the face of F1, but also its voice and conscience and has used his stature like no other F1 world champion. F1's first and only Black world champion in its 70-year history, this year he became one of sport's leading voices in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. With Hamilton being a force for change, Mercedes -- famous for its silver livery -- unveiled an all-black car for this season in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, with the drivers wearing black uniforms and the halos of both cars featuring the call to ""End Racism."" Lewis Hamilton vs. Michael Schumacher: Who is the greatest? The Briton's own incredible story -- his father, Anthony, juggled three jobs, re-mortgaged the family home and dipped into his life savings to keep his son in karting -- is an example of how notoriously difficult the sport is to enter, mainly because of the financial costs involved.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Hamilton said: ""It is no secret that I have walked this sport alone as the only person of color here.""The fact is I am bi-racial ... and there is colorism that people should perhaps read about.""When I was younger I didn't have anybody in the sport that looked like me so it was easy to think that's not possible to get there because nobody of your colour has ever been there, you don't see any Black people in F1.""But hopefully this sends a message to the kids that are watching ... that it doesn't matter where you come from, whatever your background, it is so important to you to dream big.""You can create your own path and that is what I have been able to do, and it has been so tough. Tough doesn't even describe how hard it has been.""An emotional Hamilton after the race. He later said he would probably celebrate with some minestrone soup and wine. Immediately after the race, Hamilton sat in his car with his head buried in his hands and struggled to hold back the tears.""Very rarely do I lose control of my emotions but I remember those last few laps and I was just telling myself to keep it together,"" Hamilton told reporters. ""When I came across the line it really hit me and I just burst into tears. ""I didn't want the visor to come up and people to see the tears because I always would say you will never see me cry. I remember watching other drivers cry in the past, and I was like, I am never going to do that, but it was too much.""Lewis Hamilton 'won't stop' his fight against racism as FIA rules out investigation into Breonna Taylor T-shirtHamilton needed to finish eight points ahead of his teammate Valtteri Bottas to secure the title at Istanbul Park. He did so with ease, lapping the Finn who crossed the line in 14th to collect zero points. Driving in the same Mercedes machinery, Bottas' performance illustrated just how superior a talent Hamilton is. No one has come close to challenging the world champion during this truncated season and he secured the title with three races still remaining, having won four races in a row and 10 of 14 races so far this year.",2020-11-16T08:41:51Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/motorsport/lewis-hamilton-world-title-reaction-spt-int/index.html,2020-11-16 11:20:59.844991,CNN,sports,0
China looms as Biden's biggest foreign policy challenge. Here's where he stands,"As United States President-elect Joe Biden faces an ugly, potentially contested transition, foreign policy may be the last thing on his mind.  But in capitals around the world, foreign leaders are already clamoring for his attention, hoping to reset relationships and restore norms that shifted under President Donald Trump.  Nowhere will there be greater opportunity for a shift than in the US-China relationship, which has deteriorated to historic lows during Trump's term in office. Over the past four years, both sides have slapped the other with trade tariffs, restricted access for tech companies, journalists and diplomats, shuttered consulates, and squared off militarily in the South China Sea.  Analysts in both countries are still debating whether Biden will embrace Trump's more punitive policies towards China or move to reset relations between Washington and Beijing. Even in Chinese state-run media, there are signs the ruling Communist Party is holding its breath, unsure of which direction the new administration will take.  Read More""China should not harbor any illusions that Biden's election will ease or bring a reversal to China-US relations, nor should it weaken its belief in improving bilateral ties. US competition with China and its guard against China will only intensify,"" state-run tabloid Global Times said in an editorial Sunday.As yet, no official policy statements on China have been released by the Biden transition team. Biden, though, is no foreign policy novice. During his almost five decades in national politics, Biden has repeatedly brushed up against China. As a senator, he played a role in China becoming a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001. Analysts are now looking back over past statements and more recent comments made on the campaign trail for insight into how Biden will approach what might be his most pressing foreign policy challenge.   Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan are welcomed by then-US Vice President Joe Biden and his wife at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington D.C. in 2015.Relations with BeijingDuring the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice-president from 2009 to 2017, relations with Beijing were assigned a high degree of importance, stemming in part from China's new status as the world's second-largest economy. Though China was gaining strength both economically and militarily, diplomacy during this period was guided for the most part by attempts at cooperation, rather than confrontation. Major disputes were mostly contained, and centered on security issues, such as China's military buildup in the South China Sea and cyber espionage. According to Obama, the relationship between two countries would shape the 21st century, and therefore stable relations were critical not only for the US, but for the world at large. How China's Xi Jinping blew a golden opportunity with US President Donald TrumpBiden traveled to Beijing on numerous occasions during efforts to gain Chinese support for a number of key Obama policies, including attempts to contain North Korea's nuclear ambitions. During one such trip in 2013, Biden met with President Xi Jinping, who referred to the then Vice President as an ""old friend of China."" A scheduled 45-minute private talk between the two leaders ran for two hours. In public remarks, Biden described relations in optimistic terms. ""If we get this relationship right with a genuine new model, the possibilities are limitless."" But despite accusations from the Trump campaign that Biden was too close to China, there is evidence that his views have shifted in recent years in line with the changing mood in Washington, where Beijing is increasingly viewed not as America's potential partner, but as its primary rival. During the Democratic primaries in February, Biden referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as a ""thug,"" and said that Beijing had to ""play by the rules."" A Biden campaign ad in June accused Trump of getting ""played"" by China. The renewed focus on China is evident in the Democratic Party platform document, which was released in August 2020. During the last presidential campaign in 2016 the document made only seven references to China. This year's version had more than 22.""Democrats will be clear, strong, and consistent in pushing back where we have profound economic, security, and human rights concerns about the actions of China's government,"" the 2020 platform said.TradeOne of the main planks of President Trump's foreign policy platform has been his trade war with China. Since mid-2018, the Trump administration has placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, in an attempt to drive down the US trade deficit with China and force Beijing to further open its economy.Beijing and Washington struck a ""phase one"" trade deal in January 2020, but many areas of disagreement still remain unaddressed, including China's subsidies for state-owned companies that are competing on the global market.Recent remarks from Biden suggest he would continue to take action against Beijing over its economic policies. But in an interview with NPR in August, he made it clear he believed that tariffs were as bad for the US as they were for China.What Joe Biden's win means for the world""Manufacturing's gone in recession. Agriculture lost billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay. We're going after China in the wrong way,"" he said.Instead Biden appears to favor building a global coalition to force China into liberalizing its economy. ""What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done,"" Biden said during his second debate with Trump in October. ""We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, 'These are the rules. You play by them, or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them economically'.""There are also signs that Biden may embrace aspects of Trump's tech war against China. Under Trump, the US has tried to push diplomatic partners to reject 5G technology made in China, cut off Beijing from vital US components and targeted popular apps run by Chinese companies.Biden said in September that he was concerned about the widely-used Chinese-owned app TikTok, which has been a prominent target of the Trump administration. ""I think that it's a matter of genuine concern that TikTok, a Chinese operation, has access to over 100 million young people particularly in the United States of America,"" he said.In the 2020 Democratic Platform, there is another hint that a Biden administration will continue Trump's push to stop allies from using 5G technology produced by Chinese tech giant Huawei. ""We will work with our allies and partners to develop secure 5G networks and address threats in cyberspace,"" the platform said.South China SeaBoth the Obama and the Trump administrations have pursued policies that pushed back against the Chinese government's broad, unproven claims in the South China Sea.It was during the Obama-Biden administration that the Chinese government began to construct and militarize artificial islands in the vast waterway. The US then started freedom of navigation operations in the region, sailing US naval vessels in close proximity to the artificial islands and reefs built by Beijing in a show that Washington would not acknowledge China's claims.China's military rise poses the greatest foreign policy challenge to the next US PresidentUnder Trump, the US has stepped up these operations and publicly declared that ""most"" of China's claims to the sea are illegal.Biden has made no major public statements on the South China Sea but there is no indication at this stage that he will reverse Trump's tough policies in the region -- he might even strengthen them.In 2016 the Democratic platform referred simply to protecting ""freedom of the seas in the South China Sea."" Four years later, it now explicitly warns of ""the Chinese military's intimidation"" in the region.More than once during his campaign, Biden has told the story of how he bluntly informed President Xi in 2013 that the US would continue to fly planes through the region, despite the Chinese government setting up an unrecognized Air Defense Identification Zone.""(He said) you can't fly through them. I said we're going to fly through them ... We're not going to pay attention,"" Biden said during his second debate with Trump in October.Biden has reinforced his position on staring down China's expansionist claims in Asia Pacific since becoming President-elect. In a phone call with Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide on Thursday, Biden committed to defending the contested Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by both Japan and China.TaiwanUnder President Trump, the US has moved to strengthen official ties with Taiwan, especially during the past 12 months. The Trump administration has authorized billions of dollars of arms sales to the self-governed island and, in August, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar became most senior US official to visit Taiwan in decades.Biden has long been in favor of US support for Taiwan and its democratically elected government. In fact, during his time as a senator, the President-elect voted for the original Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, which allowed the US to maintain unofficial relations with Taipei while also formally recognizing the Beijing government.Analysis: Whether Trump or Biden wins in November, Beijing will be hoping to reset the US-China relationship China maintains that Taiwan is part of its territory, even though the two sides have been governed separately since the end of a civil war in 1949. Chinese President Xi has pledged to ""reunite"" Taiwan with mainland China, by force if necessary. In an opinion piece written in 2001, the then-senator said that the US had a ""vital interest in helping Taiwan sustain its vibrant democracy."" But he made it clear that the US didn't have an ""obligation"" to defend the island from attack. ""The president should not cede to Taiwan, much less to China, the ability automatically to draw us into a war across the Taiwan Strait,"" he said.Biden hasn't spoken extensively about Taiwan on the campaign trail or since beginning his transition. But there is no indication he is planning to back down on Trump's policies.Biden tweeted his congratulations to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen when she was re-elected in January 2020 and she reciprocated when he won in November.In a telling sign, the Democratic Party removed all mention of a ""One China"" policy from its platform in 2020, the agreement by which the US acknowledged that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. The policy, which had featured in 2016, was replaced by new seemingly updated language. Instead, the Democrats are now committed to continuing ""a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan.""Xinjiang and Hong KongSince the Trump administration took power in 2017, there has been a growing stream of reports of widespread human rights abuses in China's western region of Xinjiang.The US State Department estimates up to two million citizens from Muslim minorities, including a large number of Uyghur people, have been held in detention centers, where former detainees allege they were indoctrinated, abused and even sterilized.Uyghurs are desperate for action in Xinjiang. Some say only Trump can helpIn the past 12 months, the Trump administration has taken a series of punitive actions against China over its Xinjiang policies, including sanctions targeting Communist Party officials and bans on goods made possibly with Uyghur forced labor.Ahead of the election on November 3, a number of Uyghur exiles told CNN that they were concerned that Biden wasn't tough enough to take on Beijing and produce real results for their friends and families in Xinjiang.But all statements by Biden, his campaign and the Democratic Party point show little tolerance for Beijing's alleged targeting of the Uyghurs and hints that a Biden administration will take further action.Speaking about Chinese President Xi at a Democratic Primary debate in February, Biden said, ""This is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uyghurs in 'reconstruction camps,' meaning concentration camps.""The Biden campaign has labeled China's actions in Xinjiang ""genocide,"" a label which the Trump administration was still debating earlier this year. If a Biden administration adopted the same language, it would put the US far ahead of most other nations in its condemnation of Beijing.Exiled Uyghurs aren't alone in their concerns that Trump leaving the White House would lead to the US backing down on its tough approach to China.Many pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong, who have been struggling against a Chinese government crackdown on civil liberties in the international financial hub, had also hoped for a second Trump term, citing concerns that Biden won't be tough enough on Beijing.But in a statement in May, Biden's campaign blamed Trump for China's crackdown in Hong Kong and promised that going forward there would be ""clear, strong, and consistent on values when it comes to China.""CNN's James Griffiths, Steven Jiang and Jill Disis contributed to this story.",2020-11-16T01:23:21Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/asia/biden-china-policy-trump-us-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-16 11:39:15.434663,CNN,politics,0
Giuliani's day in a Pennsylvania courtroom representing Donald Trump,"Rudy Giuliani, representing President Donald Trump's campaign, tried to deliver a sweeping broadside against mail-in voting Tuesday in a federal courtroom, only to face questions from a judge who suggested that the President's campaign shouldn't even be in court.Judge Matthew Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania hasn't yet ruled on whether the Trump campaign could block Pennsylvania's election results by claiming constitutional violations. Instead, the judge listened patiently for hours on Tuesday in Williamsport, then lobbed tough questions to Giuliani and other Trump lawyers. The Trump campaign has made bold swings at President-elect Joe Biden's win in Pennsylvania, and the state's use of mail-in ballots, claiming that two voters in Lancaster and Fayette counties couldn't cure absentee ballots they cast with procedural mistakes in them, while those in other counties were allowed to correct ballot problems.Rudy Giuliani's conspiracy theories could be dangerous to democracy, experts say""You're alleging that the two individual plaintiffs were denied the right to vote,"" Brann asked the Trump campaign attorney at one point, ""But at bottom, you're asking this court to invalidate more than 6.8 million votes, thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the Commonwealth. Could you tell me how this result could possibly be justified?""The entrance in court of Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and federal prosecutor who hadn't argued before a trial judge in decades, signals an approaching end to the Trump campaign's wild legal scramble in court to stop the formalization of Biden's victory.Read MoreSince the election, in news conferences and other appearances, Giuliani has pushed conspiracy theories about voter fraud and promised a dazzling legal strategy that hasn't materialized. He's also clashed with election law brass in the Trump campaign, as the President has refused to concede or even acknowledge Biden's win. Tuesday, Giuliani argued that the Trump campaign has been blocked from observing ballot processing in key cities and saying Democrats could have conspired to commit election fraud by counting absentee votes -- both assertions others judges have rejected repeatedly in court as unfounded or wrong. Michigan's largest county certifies election results after Republicans earlier blocked certification""If this is allowed without serious sanctions, this will become an epidemic,"" Giuliani said. ""It just all happened to be in big cities controlled by Democrats who all of a sudden decided you don't have the right to inspect an absentee ballot. ... You'd have to be a fool to think this was an accident.""Brann, an Obama appointee who is a longtime Republican, pressed the campaign on why it believed it could carry forward grievances of voters in court, when the individuals themselves are not allowed to sue over broad election mismanagement in the federal system. He asked why the campaign had come to a federal court at all, when allegations about local officials could have been taken to state court.Giuliani's answers largely stuck with generalizations that Democratic-leaning counties had conspired to hurt the President, and that absentee voting was unfair when counties administered it differently.At one point, Giuliani admitted the state court had dried up as an avenue for the Trump campaign complaints. At another point, when pressed, Giuliani admitted he wasn't alleging voter fraud -- but did still believe in the idea that fraud could exist.Fact checking Trump's barrage of lies over the weekend""No, your honor, we are not"" alleging fraud, Giuliani said, after Brann reminded him a newer version of the Trump campaign's lawsuit cut back those claims. It's a ""fraudulent process,"" Giuliani continued.""So you are alleging a fraud,"" the judge responded, noting that would require a higher standard than suspicion to bring a case.Giuliani's big entranceTrump and his backers have faced ridicule from the legal community for bringing meritless lawsuits to challenge the election and spread disinformation to undermine Biden's win, and legal experts have repeatedly said the cases won't give Trump a second term in office.Since the election, judges in multiple states have quickly rejected the Trump campaign's and his supporters' suspicions of voting fraud, because even in-court witnesses have shown no reason to believe there's widespread fraud. Pennsylvania Supreme Court rules Trump campaign observers had no right to stand within a specific distance during Philadelphia ballot processingThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court even added to the Trump campaign pile on, releasing an opinion just after Giuliani finished his opening arguments. The state's highest court essentially undercut Giuliani's argument to Brann that ballot processing observers had been treated so unfairly by Democratic-run city governments, they were entitled to a court's help. ""The state courts are virtually closed to us now,"" Giuliani acknowledged to Brann, after receiving the state high court's ruling.The Pennsylvania federal case has always been extremely unlikely to succeed. But among a smattering of legal complaints, it's considered the most notable of Trump's last-ditch efforts to block battleground state's votes for Biden. It certainly drew the most attention. On Tuesday, tweets from legal experts and reporters, including some in Williamsport, catalogued the proceedings in real time, with a particular focus on how Giuliani hasn't argued in a courtroom in decades. At times, the former New York mayor and federal prosecutor appeared to approach the case like a criminal trial instead of a lawsuit in its early stage, announcing ""exhibits"" he had brought for the judge and describing ""charges"" in the lawsuit. He also appeared to confuse legal terminology at times, or answer the judge's questions about specific case law with colloquialism. When asked what type of scrutiny the judge should apply in the case -- a type of question that has specific legal terms for possible answers -- Giuliani answered: the ""normal"" kind. When the judge then asked about ""rational basis scrutiny,"" a specific legal term for weighing constitutional cases, Giuliani responded by calling the vote processing situation in the state not rational.At one point 8,000 people in total listened to the proceeding on two phone lines.Mark Aronchick, a lawyer for a handful of Pennsylvania counties who argued against Giuliani, called his time in court ""disgraceful,"" during his own argument time before the judge.Another lawyer in court Tuesday, David Zionts of the NAACP, noted that election procedure challenges had to have been brought before the election, not after.Still, the case won't be resolved for days. Brann said he would consider more arguments in writing in the coming days, and canceled a hearing planned for Thursday where witnesses could have testified. He then encouraged lawyers to stay in the remote north-central Pennsylvania town for dinner and a drink, perhaps with the opposing side. ""A lot of these arguments can be cured with a drink and dinner,"" he said.Jenna Ellis, another lawyer for Trump, tweeted after the hearing that she believed Giuliani had established ""great rapport"" with the judge.This story has been updated with details of Tuesday's hearing.",2020-11-17T16:16:52Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/trump-giuliani-election-lawsuit/index.html,2020-11-18 09:06:46.697080,CNN,politics,0
"Chuck Grassley, 87-year-old Iowa GOP senator, tests positive for Covid-19","Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is 87 years old, tweeted that he tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday, after saying earlier he would self isolate after a possible exposure.""I've tested positive for coronavirus,"" Grassley wrote. ""I'll (be) following my doctors' orders/CDC guidelines & continue to quarantine. I'm feeling good + will keep up on my work for the ppl of Iowa from home. I appreciate everyone's well wishes + prayers &look fwd to resuming my normal schedule soon."" Grassley, as president pro tempore, is the most senior Republican in the chamber.It's unclear which if any senators who interacted with Grassley on Monday would isolate themselves. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership, said Grassley attended their Republican leadership meeting Monday. Asked if any who attended the meeting will quarantine, Blunt, who chairs the Senate Rules Committee, told reporters: ""You'd have to ask them.""He added, ""I was like, 12 feet away from him at the meeting that's why we're in that big room.""Read More""We are all spread out,"" GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming told CNN of the leadership meeting. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who attended Monday's leadership meeting, said they were wearing masks.On whether there are any other precautions being taken, as Grassley presided over the Senate floor on Monday and attended meetings, Blunt said Tuesday: ""He did. He did. And he's been great about wearing his mask and I think great about taking care of himself, and so I think he's done everything he can ... does everything he could be expected to do to protect himself and the rest of us. People catch this.""""Not that I know of,"" Barrasso, who is also in GOP leadership, told CNN when asked if they will have to take extra precautions now that Grassley tested positive.Grassley missed Tuesday's votes because of his quarantine, his first missed vote since 1993 when he missed due to floods in his state, according to his office.Grassley is the second GOP senator in under a week to announce that he's isolating after a possible Covid exposure. Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Saturday that he was isolating as well after coming into ""contact with someone who subsequently tested positive for COVID.""Grassley was seen at the Capitol speaking to reporters Monday afternoon.At least two members of the US House of Representatives announced Monday they tested positive for Covid-19 and another member announced he was isolating after possibly being exposed, a sign of the looming threat of coronavirus on Capitol Hill.Colorado Rep. Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat, announced Tuesday that he had tested positive for the virus and was isolating.""I learned today that I have tested positive for COVID-19. As of now, I am asymptomatic and I'm feeling good. I am currently in Washington D.C. and plan to isolate in my apartment while continuing to work and voting remotely,"" he said in a statement.The threat of coronavirus has been a consistent influence over leaders from both parties and chambers of Congress since the pandemic began, and how lawmakers react has been under increased scrutiny amid the latest wave of cases sweeping the country.Grassley's announcement also comes a day after a dispute on the Senate floor when Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown was recognized by Alaskan GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan and asked Sullivan to put on a face mask.""I'd start by asking the presiding officer to please wear a mask as he speaks and people below him are — I can't tell you what to do,"" Brown said, referring to Sullivan.""I don't wear a mask when I'm speaking, like most senators,"" Sullivan responded.Brown responded angrily: ""I know you don't need my instruction, but there clearly isn't much interest in this body in public health. We have a president who hasn't shown up at the coronavirus task force meeting in months. We have a majority leader that calls us back here to vote on an unqualified nominee, and at the same time to vote for judge after judge after judge, exposing all the people who can't say anything, I understand, the people in front of you, and the presiding officer, and expose all the staff here, and the Majority Leader just doesn't seem to care.""This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.CNN's Manu Raju and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.",2020-11-17T15:29:03Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/politics/chuck-grassley-covid-19-senate-congress/index.html,2020-11-18 09:07:09.977276,CNN,politics,0
Leonid meteor shower will shoot fireballs across the sky this week,"In the early morning hours on Tuesday, the Leonid meteor shower will send shooting stars across the sky. Meteors can be harder to see when there is a bright moon, but fortunately the moon will only be 5% visible, according to the American Meteor Society. The meteor shower is expected to peak on November 16 and 17. The Leonids will be most visible from the Northern Hemisphere, but you can also view them from the Southern Hemisphere. 'Fireball' meteorite that fell to Earth in 2018 reveals its secretsWeather can also impact visibility. The United States should have mostly clear skies during the peak nights, except for some storms along the West Coast, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.The diminutive Comet Tempel-Tuttle, the parent body of the Leonids, will cross Earth's orbit, creating a vaporizing shower of debris in the atmosphere. The comet takes 33 years to complete one orbit of the sun.Typically, there are between 10 and 15 meteors per hour. Check online to see when it will be visible in your part of the world.Read MoreSometimes the Leonid meteors can shoot across the sky in brilliant colors. The color of the meteor depends on the metal in the meteor, and for these green ones, it was likely magnesium, according to NASA. The meteor shower gets its name from the constellation Leo the Lion, as the meteors will be coming from the stars that make up the lion's mane. But you don't need to look in the direction of the constellation, because the meteors will appear all across the sky.The bright meteors can also be colorful, and they're fast, moving at 44 miles per second -- among the fastest meteors. Fireballs and ""earthgrazer"" meteors are also a hallmark of the Leonid shower. Fireballs are brighter and larger and can last longer than the average meteor, while earthgrazers appear close to the horizon with long, colorful tails.A leonid meteor shoots across the sky in Tucson, Arizona, with Jupiter and Venus visible as well. The Leonid meteor shower overlaps with the Northern Taurid meteor shower, so some meteors from that shower may be visible as well. The Northern Taurids are also known for their fireballs, which means if you spot a fireball or two it could have originated from that shower.Unfortunately, this year's shower won't produce a meteor storm, which is when you can see upward of 1,000 meteors per hour. Although such an event has been associated with the Leonid meteor shower before, the last storm happened in 2001. Rare NASA photos up for auction, including the only photograph of Neil Armstrong on the moon The best time to see the meteor showers will be between midnight and dawn on both mornings, wherever you are in the world. Light pollution from cities can obstruct the view, so drive out to a quieter place with fewer lights.Find an open area with a wide view of the sky, and don't forget to bundle up. If you want to photograph the Leonid meteor shower, NASA suggests using a camera with manual focus on a tripod with a shutter release cable or built-in timer, fitted with a wide-angle lens.",2020-11-15T11:08:37Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/world/leonid-meteor-shower-2020-scn/index.html,2020-11-16 11:38:54.495256,CNN,travel,0
Dustin Johnson wins 2020 Masters at Augusta National,"World number one Dustin Johnson entered the history books as he won the 84th Masters in record-breaking style at Augusta National on Sunday.The 36-year-old American was claiming his second major title after a string of near misses and secured it by a five-stroke margin after a final round 68.It left him at 20-under 268, beating the previous tournament best of 18-under set by both defending champion Tiger Woods, in 1997, and Jordan Spieth, in 2015.Tiger Woods cards a 10 on notorious par-three hole at Masters to make history for all the wrong reasons He is the first top ranked golfer to win the Masters since Woods in 2002. And he has also beaten another Woods record by compiling his 11th straight round under par at Augusta.Fifteen-time major champion Woods, who was in contention after a first round 68, achieved an unwelcome record of his own in round four, racking up a 7-over 10 at the treacherous short 12th -- the worst single hole score of his professional career.Read MoreJohnson, coming up behind, avoided the pitfall of Rae's Creek at that hole, which has ended the hopes of many contenders, and marched serenely on to his triumph with Sungjae Kim of South Korea and Australia's Cameron Smith in a tie for second at 15-under.Woods presented Johnson the famous green jacket in the Butler Cabin, and Johnson admitted that he had been feeling the pressure going into the final round, despite his usual calm demeanor.""I was nervous all day. I could feel it. The Masters to me is the biggest tournament, it's the one I wanted to win the most,"" he said. ""I'm just very proud of the way I handled myself and the way I finished off the golf tournament.""A dream come true.

""As a kid, dreaming about winning and having Tiger put the green jacket on you, it still seems like it's a dream, but I'm here and what a great feeling it is and I couldn't be more excited.""Ahead by four shots overnight, Johnson was hot favorite to don the green jacket, despite being 0-4 in previous majors when leading before the final round.But after a birdie on the third, the frontrunner offered a ray of light to his nearest challengers, Sungjae Im and Cameron Smith, with bogeys on the 4th and 5th, ending a run of 33 bogey-free holes.Masters debutant Im birdied the 2nd and 3rd holes and closed to within a shot of Johnson at one point, but he could get no closer as he bogeyed the 6th and 7th, answered in part by a birdie on the 8th.Record 20-under tallySmith also hung tough with some spectacular recovery shots, but a hat trick of birdies for Johnson at the 13th, 14th and 15th gave him a comfortable cushion as he became the first player in Masters history to reach 20-under-par.Johnson was able to par home for his 24th career PGA title, his four bogeys in the week the fewest of any Masters champion. The 22-year-old Im, who was bidding to become the second Asian player to win a major, can take comfort from a solid last day performance as he carded a 69, while Smith can count himself unfortunate to be the first player in Masters history to shoot all four of his rounds in the 60s but still to come up short.Cameron Smith, of Australia, watches his tee shot on the ninth hole during the final round of the Masters. ""That's cool,"" he said. ""A lot of good around here this week.""Behind the leading trio, world number three Justin Thomas claimed 4th place on 12-under while Rory McIlroy finished tied 5th with Dylan Frittelli of South Africa a further shot back.McIlroy, seeking the career Grand Slam, looked set to challenge with three birdies in his outward nine, but a bogey on the 10th halted his progress and he was once again unable to capitalize on the 13th and 15th par fives.No.1 Dustin Johnson on record run as he leads Masters by four shots""I didn't have a great start but over the last 54 holes, only two bogeys, a lot of great golf in there,"" McIlroy said.

""I've got to fix this dizziness or whatever is going on. I've got to get healthy first and foremost.""DeChambeau and the world's other leading golfers will not have too long to wait for another chance of winning the Masters, with the famous major set to move back to its April slot next year after it was put back to November this year because of the global pandemic.",2020-11-15T19:57:59Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/golf/golf-masters-dustin-johnson-wins-masters/index.html,2020-11-16 11:20:39.336208,CNN,sports,0
Pepsi unveils first 2-liter bottle redesign in nearly 30 years,"PepsiCo's line of chubby plastic 2-liter bottles are getting a slimmer redesign — the first in about three decades.Beginning this week, some US customers will see in stores a new bottle with an enhanced ""grip point"" at the bottom that's 25% slimmer than the old bottle, among other design changes.

US Coronavirus: Experts are encouraged by early Covid-19 vaccine findings but warn the US will still face challenging months ahead,"The US received more good news on the vaccine front this week -- with Moderna's clinical trial data showing its vaccine is more than 94% effective. But the country is still battling a Covid-19 crisis that's ravaging communities and hospital systems and is projected to get a lot worse before a possible vaccine could offer any help.""We have learned that these colder months when people are clustering inside, the numbers are going to go up,"" CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Monday night. ""Hospitalizations are expected to maybe even hit 100,000.""""We used to talk about the number of people becoming newly infected on any given day hitting 100,000 seemed outrageous. There may be that many people in the hospitals,"" he added. The US has now recorded more than 100,000 daily infections for two weeks straight and on Monday reported more than 166,000 new cases. On the same day, another new high: more than 73,000 Covid-19 hospitalized patients nationwide, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. Coronavirus vaccines: Your questions answeredAcross the country, hospitals are filling up. Read More""When you look at Utah, or Montana or the Dakotas, they just have such a fewer number of ICU beds and specialists, that when they get at capacity, it's going to be a breaking point for them in a way it wasn't for us in the coastal cities and states,"" Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician at Columbia University Medical Center, said Monday at an online event hosted by Stat.In St. Louis, officials announced modeling data suggesting ICU capacity could run out around the first week of December if current rates continue. ""Covid-19 is spreading much too quickly and sending far too many people to our hospitals and intensive care units,"" Incident Commander of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force Dr. Alex Garza said Monday. ""We are now at a tipping point. The actions that we take today will determine what the next weeks and months will look like.""And while hundreds of Americans continue to die every day, that number will likely only rise as hospitalizations keep going up, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Mark McClellan told CNN Monday. ""The problem is that we've got these outbreaks, these hot spot areas where we're approaching health system capacity really all over the country now, it's not just one part of the country or region,"" he said.Preparing for a vaccine  And while the high efficacy rates coming out of the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trials are a good first step, a vaccine has yet to be approved and experts will also have to decide which groups should get vaccinated first.An advisory committee to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to meet next week to decided who will get the vaccine first, a longtime member of the committee said.Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices received notice last week that they'll meet November 23 for five hours, according to committee member Dr. William Schaffner. Among the first to be vaccinated will likely be health care workers and essential workers as well as people over the age of 65 and people with existing health conditions. The question is what order those groups should come in, Schaffner said. ""Health care workers are baked in -- that's the first thing to happen, no doubt about that,"" he said. But after that, committee members will need to define what underlying conditions would merit getting a vaccine early on and what defines ""essential workers"" -- a group that could include everyone from police officers to supermarket clerks. And even once a vaccine is approved and more doses become available, it will be months before the US returns to anything resembling normalcy.""There's not going to be one day when, you know, the light switch is going to go on and everybody is going be immune,"" McClellan said. ""But we should do a gradually better and better job of containing spread, of avoiding hospitalizations and moving beyond the pandemic in the months to come."" ""But we have got a couple of tough months to get through first,"" he added. Statewide measures taking effect this week More state leaders have in the past week announced new restrictions in efforts of helping to slow the spread. Oklahoma's governor announced that starting Thursday, all tables in restaurants must be at least six feet apart and added that bars and restaurants will have to close by 11 p.m. Only restaurant drive-thru windows or curbside pickup will be allowed after that. And starting Tuesday, all 33,000 state employees under the executive branch will be required to wear a mask in common areas or when they're around other people, the governor's office said. Inmates in El Paso are volunteering to move bodies of Covid-19 victims at medical examiner's officeIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state is experiencing the ""fastest increase in cases we have seen yet"" and announced 28 counties were moving into the most restrictive tier of the state's reopening plan. New restrictions went into effect in Washington state Monday, which limit bars and restaurants to outdoors with capacity limits and to-go service. Indoor social gatherings with people from outside the home are also prohibited under the restrictions, unless participants quarantine for 14 days prior, or quarantine for seven days before the gathering and receive a negative Covid-19 test result no more than 48 hours prior. New measures will also take effect in Oregon Wednesday, when the state will go into a ""Two-Week Freeze.""

Guidance for college students returning homeAs the Thanksgiving holiday nears, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont issued guidance on Monday for out-of-state college students who are planning on returning home to the state for Thanksgiving.Lamont asked the returning students to self-quarantine for 14 days before or after returning home, get tested for the virus both before leaving school and after getting home, not attend parties or reunions and not quarantine with any elderly or high-risk family members. Don't rely on a negative test result to see your family for Thanksgiving""We can't enforce this,"" he said.

How to outsmart fake news in your Facebook feed,"Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true. It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit. It doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis, the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute.  First, know the different types of misleading and false news1. Fake newsThese are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real. 2. Misleading news These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article. 3. Highly partisan news A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda. 4. Clickbait The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised. 5. Satire This one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate. Second, hone your fact-checking skills Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a ""healthy amount of skepticism"" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news. ""If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,"" he told CNN. Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content. ""People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,"" she told CNN. ""I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.""For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:1. Does the story come from a strange URL?     Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like "".co"" or "".su,"" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales. Read More2. Does the headline match the information in the article?      Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through. Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. ""Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',"" trumpeted one such headline. However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to ""take their business elsewhere.""3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?      Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney. A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry. It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015.  It had nothing to do with the election results at all. 4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?      Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. ""IT BEGINS,"" read the headline. However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the ""bathroom bill"" was to be passed. In fact, according to Snopes, the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy. 5. Does the article cite primary sources?      It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral. One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a ""clear parasite"" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel. Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake. 6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it: People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them. 7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story? During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as ""reported"" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as ""reported"" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt. 8. Is your own bias getting in the way?Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence. ""We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,"" says Zimdars. ""If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.""So if you find an outrageous article that feels ""too good to be true,"" use caution: It just might be. 9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization? Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you're getting the real deal. View the whole list here. 10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites? This is where things can get tricky. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list. While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as ""fake"" is not accurate. ""I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,"" she says. ""It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.""

Thousands of cars form lines to collect food in Covid-hit Texas,"Thousands of people lined up for groceries at a food bank distribution event in Dallas, Texas, this weekend, with organizers saying the Covid-19 pandemic has increased need in the city.Texas becomes the first US state with more than 1 million Covid-19 infections North Texas Food Bank (NTFB) distributed more than 600,000 pounds of food for about 25,000 people on Saturday, according to spokeswoman Anna Kuruan.

Airbnb has filed to go public as the pandemic rages on,"Even as the pandemic that wrecked its business flares up again, Airbnb is poised to make its public market debut this year.The company filed its long-awaited IPO paperwork Monday, revealing that it turned a profit of $219 million in the third quarter of this year, on $1.34 billion in revenue. By comparison, it made $227 million in profit during the same quarter last year on $1.65 billion in revenue. The third quarter was the only quarter the company was profitable in 2019.The first half of 2020 was bleak for Airbnb, whose platform is used to find and book accommodations in 220 countries and regions around the world. The company reported that through June 30, it incurred net losses of $916 million on revenue of $1.18 billion. Airbnb's IPO prospectus comes amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic, with the United States surpassing 11 million Covid-19 cases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminding people that staying home is the best way to protect against the virus. ""During the fourth quarter of 2020, another wave of Covid-19 infections emerged,"" the company wrote in its filing, warning that it expects to see greater declines in bookings and cancellations in the current quarter than in the third quarter of this year.Read MoreAirbnb plans to list on the Nasdaq under the stock ticker ""ABNB.""In September 2019, Airbnb announced that it planned to become a public company this year. Nearly a year later, in August 2020, the company said it had submitted confidential paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, making clear it intended to move ahead with plans to go public even as the pandemic devastated the travel industry and forced the startup to lay off a quarter of its workforce. Founded in 2008 as Airbed & Breakfast by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb has upended the hotel industry through popularizing the once unthinkable idea of renting out rooms in the homes of strangers. It has since expanded its offerings to include full apartments, homes, and hotels as well as travel experiences. One of the most valuable private startups in the world, Airbnb reached a valuation of $31 billion at one point.Airbnb previously said it was profitable, excluding some expenses, in 2017 and 2018 setting it apart from many other so-called unicorn companies that have struggled to meet even that benchmark. Food delivery giant DoorDash files paperwork to go publicThe ongoing global pandemic has rattled its business and many of the hosts who power it. In May, CEO Brian Chesky wrote in a letter to employees that its business had been ""hit hard"" and revenue for the year was expected to be less than half of what the company earned in 2019. Airbnb reported revenue of $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared to $3.7 billion during the same period in 2019. The company reported overall revenue of $4.8 billion in 2019.In June, however, Chesky told CNN he was still open to making a Wall Street debut happen. ""It's not off the table, but we're definitely not committing to anything right now,"" Chesky told CNN's Poppy Harlow. ""We're going to keep our options open.""The company's business was hit hardest by the pandemic in March and April when it had more cancellations than bookings. But it has seen improvement in recent months, driven by those using its platform for domestic and short-distance travel. ""We believe that the Covid-19 pandemic reinforced that travel is an enduring human desire, even in the face of challenges. People have increasingly sought travel options closer to home,"" the company said. Airbnb is one of the most highly anticipated public offerings in the tech sector this year. DoorDash, another sharing economy company, made its IPO prospectus public last week. But unlike the travel industry, the on-demand food delivery space where DoorDash is the US market leader, has soared as people have increasingly stayed at home this year due to the coronavirus.Airbnb's board includes big names like former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and former Pixar executive Ann Mather. Meanwhile, Chesky also has his fair share of prominent mentors to go to for advice, including Warren Buffett, Bob Iger and Barack Obama.Like other emerging sharing economy startups, Airbnb has faced a number of regulatory battles over the years with local and state governments over how it operates in their jurisdictions and the issue remains an ongoing risk to its business. In its filing, the company outlined that it is ""subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.""More recently, Airbnb has grappled with the misuse of Airbnb rental properties for house parties. In August, it announced a global ban on all parties and events at Airbnb listings, capping occupancy to 16 people. During the pandemic, some cities temporarily cracked down on short-term rentals, and hosts were forced to pivot rentals to 30 days or longer.CNN Business' Kaya Yurieff contributed reporting",2020-11-16T22:26:30Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/16/tech/airbnb-ipo-paperwork/index.html,2020-11-18 08:46:30.997541,CNN,financial,0
How Amazonians saved a 'Terminator' of the fish world,"As fish go, the arapaima is pretty extraordinary. Found in the Amazon river basin, it is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, capable of growing three meters long and weighing 200 kilograms (440 pounds). It breathes air, allowing it to live in water with little oxygen, and survive a day out of water altogether. It eats fish, but also birds, lizards and small mammals, crushing its prey with its tooth-covered tongue.This evolutionary masterpiece has an even greater trick -- its scales, which researchers have compared to a bullet-proof vest, protect it from piranha attacks. Tough but flexible, their properties have even attracted the attention of the US Air Force.The arapaima is a Terminator of the animal kingdom, yet it has a fatal flaw: it's good eating. Called pirarucu locally, it's also known as ""the cod of the Amazon,"" by virtue of its firm white flesh and minimal bones. The fish is an important food source for local communities, but also prized among discerning diners in some of Brazil's biggest cities.Fishermen load an arapaima onto their boat in the Western Amazon region near Volta do Bucho in the Ituxi Reserve on September 20, 2017.Overfishing led to population decline, and in the 1990s steps were taken to prohibit arapaima fishing. However, illegal fishing continued, causing the species to disappear from parts of the Amazon. But thanks to two decades of work from conservationists and local communities, that's no longer the case. Read MoreWhat's more, the arapaima hasn't disappeared from plates. In fact, consumption is crucial to the conservation model, meaning Brazilians can have their fish and eat it.JUST WATCHEDJoao Campos-Silva is on a mission to save a river giantReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJoao Campos-Silva is on a mission to save a river giant 02:50 Saving a river giantToday, fishing for arapaima is banned in Brazil unless within areas with community-based management agreements, explains João Campos-Silva, a Brazilian ecologist. Campos-Silva is part of Institutio Juruá, one of a number of organizations working with communities and fishers in grassroots programs to sustainably cultivate and ultimately revive the species. Amazon tribes are using drones to track deforestation in the Brazilian rainforestArapaima spend the wet season navigating the flooded forest where they reproduce, returning to lakes when water levels drop. Focusing on the Juruá River and surrounding lakes in northern Brazil's Amazonas state, a program implemented by Institutio Juruá over a decade ago introduced an annual population census and calculates sustainable harvest quotas for each lake for the following year (no more than 30% of adult fish, per government guidelines). Local communities guard lake entrances year-round to ward off illegal fishers coming from outside of the protected area. Harvesting is only allowed between August and November, and any fish smaller than 1.55 meters (5 feet 1 inch) long is returned to the water. João Campos Silva on the rivers of Amazonas State, Brazil.Francisco das Chagas Melo de Araújo, also known as Seu Preto, is a community leader from Xibauazinho, a community in Amazonas state and one of the first places to begin the program. ""Before the arapaima management ... we had no rights to take care of these lakes. Commercial fishers conducted predatory fishing, where (they) used to harvest as much as they could,"" he explains. ""Our lakes were severely depleted and overfished and the arapaima was virtually non-existent."" Find out more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable futureAfter 11 years of management, he says there are more than 4,000 arapaima in the community's lakes. This British farm went from a 'biological desert' to biodiversity hotspot by letting the animals take chargeCampos-Silva's research on lakes around the Juruá River across the same period found the arapaima population more than quadrupled. As the population has grown, arapaima have migrated to new lakes, expanding their range. He estimates there are now roughly 330,000 arapaima living in 1,358 lakes in 35 managed areas, with over 400 communities involved in managing them.Income from community fishing is ""generating clear social benefits,"" he says, funding schools and infrastructure improvements, social security and healthcare, as well as boosting gender equality.Francisco das Chagas Melo de Araújo, also known as Seu Preto (back left), a community leader from  Amazonas state, alongside a sustainably caught arapaima. Raimunda Pires de Araújo, Seu Preto's daughter, says she had no income before the management program. She's now responsible for processing and cleaning fish, and is earning money. ""This kind of opportunity increases our autonomy to fight for a better life,"" she says. ""Our job has been recognized nationally and internationally, increasing our pride and respect from other communities and organizations,"" says her father. ""Now we have the opportunity to help other communities to empower themselves.""By learning to think like a puffin, this conservationist has saved seabirds around the worldHis message to illegal fishers? ""Get organized."" Seu Preto says they should join a legal fishing program and begin sustainable harvesting. ""The greatest pride you can have is to (catch fish) and no one has the right to seize it.""Campos-Silva hopes the positive feedback loop created by the program will encourage more communities to get involved and ultimately help preserve more of the Amazon's wildlife. ""We are facing a global decline of large vertebrates,"" he says.

Analysis: Fox News' rivals are using the network's own dishonest tactics against it,"""Fox News sucks! Fox News sucks! Fox News sucks!""Those words were chanted in the streets of Washington, DC, this past weekend -- not by hordes of angry liberals but by disenchanted supporters of President Donald Trump.For more than two decades, Fox News has conditioned its audience to distrust news that collides with its worldview or theirs. Inconvenient facts have been dismissed and blamed on the ""liberal media"" or the ""deep state"" or one of the many other boogeymen favored by the right at any particular time. Fox News has never seen competition like thisBut now that strategy could be catching up to the conservative cable channel, with rising competition from networks such as Newsmax and OAN, which have positioned themselves as Trumpier than Fox.Indeed, Fox finds itself in a precarious position. Read MoreOn one hand, the network needs to maintain a semblance of having a serious news operation and its news anchors have acknowledged the reality that Trump lost the election to Joe Biden. On the other hand, the acknowledgment of reality is angering Fox's audience, some members of which are refusing to accept the truth of the matter and rebelling when it is force-fed to them. And Trump, who is livid at Fox for calling Arizona for Biden on Election Night and for not supporting him as slavishly as he would like, has been encouraging those viewers to change the channel and tune into Newsmax or OAN. Compounding the problem, the propagandists on Fox, like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, continue to undercut their own network's reporting by ludicrously suggesting that Trump could be correct to assert that something nefarious did actually take place to rig the election in favor of Biden.It is morphing into a real problem for Fox. In recent days, the Trump-friendly Newsmax — which, unlike Fox, has not acknowledged Biden as President-elect — has for the first time in its history been successful in peeling away a chunk of the audience that would normally tune into Fox's newscasts. Shows on Newsmax that were averaging less than 100,000 viewers are now amassing audiences several times as large. Last week, one show even crossed over one million viewers.It's unclear how long this trend will hold and it could very well be a short-lived phase. It is also worth noting that, even as Newsmax rips away some of its views, Fox continues to enjoy a dominant position in the conservative news market. But Fox does appear to be reacting to the challenge. It recently launched promotional spots touting the network's pro-Trump prime time lineup attacking the legitimacy of the elections, with a narrator declaring the hosts are ""speaking up for you.""All that said, it's also worth noting that Fox has armed its rivals with the very instruments they are using against it. Fox has primed viewers to distrust journalists and it has disseminated disinformation and promoted conspiracy theories that support the President. Now, Trump and these fledgling networks are wielding these tactics like a weapon against Fox. In some cases they're also using former Fox personalities against them.Newsmax hosts ""Diamond & Silk,"" who previously hosted a show on Fox's streaming service, insisted Monday that Biden is ""NOT the President"" and said, ""Somebody should let the left-wing media, including Fox News, know!""Greg Kelly, another Newsmax host who was previously a ""Fox & Friends"" host, said Monday on his show,  ""This is not over. Ignore what the mainstream media is telling you right now.""If Fox executives are frustrated or perplexed by a the portion of their audience protesting the channel, they need only to look in the mirror to understand who bears the main share of the responsibility. ",2020-11-17T17:16:54Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/media/fox-news-newsmax-ratings/index.html,2020-11-18 08:56:32.955135,CNN,politics,0
Sophia Loren returns to the screen in 'The Life Ahead',"There's one clear reason to watch ""The Life Ahead,"" but for those who appreciate cinematic history, it's a good one: Sophia Loren, still striking at 86, starring in this Italian-language film directed by her son, Edoardo Ponti.The movie premieres on Netflix, which surely is dreaming of a very nostalgic Oscar nomination for an actress recognized twice before, in what would be another 30-year increment: for ""Two Women"" in 1961, and a career-achievement honor three decades later.Ponti and writer Ugo Chiti adapted the movie from Romain Gary's novel ""The Life Before Us,"" which was previously made into the 1977 film ""Madame Rosa."" Here Loren plays the character of that title, a Holocaust survivor who takes in the children of prostitutes in the Italian town of Bari, who becomes a significant influence over a young Senegalese orphan, Momo (Ibrahima Gueye), who temporarily moves in with her. Selling drugs for a local dealer, he desperately needs a few positive influences in his life, however much he might resist them.There's really not a whole lot more to it than that, and the boy -- who delivers a wonderfully natural performance -- serves as the focal point of the story, which he narrates. Yet it's Loren who commands the screen, as Rosa snaps at him at first, before falling into spells that suggest failing health and the painful memories of the ordeal she experienced in her youth.It's a cliché to call an actor ageless, but anybody who didn't know that Loren is an octogenarian -- someone who starred opposite the likes of Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Frank Sinatra and Charlton Heston -- would be hard-pressed to believe it, despite a role that's as unglamorous as it could possibly be.Read MoreIn interviews, Loren -- whose last feature was a little over a decade ago -- has stated that she brought the project to her son, with whom she has worked on two previous movies, telling him Madame Rosa is ""a wonderful character that I think maybe I could be quite good with.""That she is. Perhaps that's why ""The Life Ahead"" has the warm feel of a family affair, and a celebration of not just Loren's contribution in this particular film, but the life, and career, behind her.""The Life Ahead"" premieres Nov. 13 on Netflix.",2020-11-13T15:25:18Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/13/entertainment/the-life-ahead-review/index.html,2020-11-16 11:12:41.513810,CNN,entertainment,0
This Japanese face mask translates into eight languages,"When the Covid-19 pandemic made face masks an everyday essential, Japanese startup Donut Robotics spotted an opportunity. They created a smart mask — a high-tech upgrade to standard face coverings, designed to make communication and social distancing easier.In conjunction with an app, the C-Face Smart mask can transcribe dictation, amplify the wearer's voice, and translate speech into eight different languages.The cutouts on the front are vital for breathability, so the smart mask doesn't offer protection against the coronavirus. Instead, it is designed to be worn over a standard face mask, explains Donut Robotics CEO Taisuke Ono. Made of white plastic and silicone, it has an embedded microphone that connects to the wearer's smartphone via Bluetooth. The system can translate between Japanese and Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indonesian, English, Spanish and French.Donut Robotics first developed the translation software for a robot called Cinnamon — but when the pandemic hit, the robot project was put on hold. That's when the team's engineers came up with the idea to use their software in a face mask. Donut Robotics CEO Taisuke Ono tests out the communication robot prototype, Cinnamon, at Tokyo's Haneda Airport in 2017.An appealing robotRead MoreDonut Robotics started life in a garage in Kitakyushu City, in Fukuoka prefecture, in 2014.Ono co-founded the company with engineer Takafumi Okabe with the aim to ""change the world with small and mobile communication robots.""With venture capital investment, the duo applied to Haneda Robotics Lab — an initiative that sought robots to provide services for visitors at Tokyo's Haneda Airport.According to a spokesperson for Haneda Robotics Lab, robots fill a need as Japan's declining workforce will make it harder to recruit human staff.Donut Robotics' Cinnamon robot — designed to provide tourists with useful information and help them to navigate the airport — was one of four translation robot prototypes selected by the project in 2016. Haneda Robotics Lab says Cinnamon beat the competition because of its appealing aesthetics and user-friendly design, and because the translation software performed well in noisy environments. The smart mask translates between Japanese and eight languages. This success prompted the company to relocate to Tokyo and take on three new team members.Ono says the Donut Robotics software uses machine learning developed with the help of translation experts and specializes in the Japanese language. He claims that ""the technology is better than Google API, or other popular technologies"" for Japanese language users, because most competitor apps focus on translating to and from English. The team started testing a prototype at Haneda Airport in 2017 and continued developing the technology.But earlier this year, Covid-19 hit Asia and the airport project ground to a halt. ""We were running short of money and wondering how to keep the company going,"" says Ono. The team sought a solution and came up with the idea to adapt its software for a product that would sell well in a pandemic. A quickly growing marketThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a boom in face mask sales, with mask-wearing in public now mandated in many countries around the world.Seeing an opportunity to monetize their translation technology, Donut Robotics launched a fundraiser on Japanese crowdfunding platform Fundinno in June. They raised 28 million yen ($265,000) in 37 minutes, says Ono. ""It was very surprising,"" he says, ""because it would usually take three or four months to get that kind of money."" Masks were commonly used in Japan even before the pandemic. Now their use is widespread.A second round of crowdfunding on Fundinno in July raised a further 56.6 million yen ($539,000), which Ono plans to use to develop translation software for the international market. To scale up production, Donut Robotics have partnered with a company in Tokyo, which they declined to name.Ono says the first wave of distribution is expected to take place in Japan, with 5,000 to 10,000 masks available by December. They will be priced at $40 to $50, he says, with an extra subscription for the app. Donut Robotics will not expand overseas until April 2021 at the earliest, but there has been interest in the UK and US, where they plan to crowdfund on Kickstarter, says Ono.The mask's Bluetooth chip can connect to smartphones up to 32 feet (10 meters) away, says Ono. He hopes the mask will make new social distancing norms in locations including hospitals and offices easier, by enabling good communication. ""We still have many situations where we have to meet in person,"" he says. ""In this new normal ... the mask and the app are very helpful.""

Lewis Hamilton: Will F1 ever seen another world champion like Briton?,"Lewis Hamilton has made history. Now a seven-time Formula One world champion, the Englishman equaled Michael Schumacher's record with a stunning victory at a wet and tumultuous Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday.Upon winning the race on Sunday, Hamilton was overcome with emotion and said over the radio through tears, to his engineers but to the wider world too, ""That's for all the kids out there who dream the impossible. You can do it too, man! I believe in you guys.""'I have walked this sport alone,' says Lewis Hamilton after record-equaling title win Hamilton's rise through motorsport is incredible because such a story is so rare. He is F1's first and only Black world champion in its 70-year history and a racing great from a humble background.""It is no secret that I have walked this sport alone as the only person of color here,"" he told reporters after record-equaling feat on Sunday. ""You can create your own path and that is what I have been able to do, and it has been so tough. Tough doesn't even describe how hard it has been.""But will there ever be a champion like Hamilton again? Will we ever see another working-class driver or a person of color achieve sustained success in motorsport?Read MoreREAD: Lewis Hamilton, Formula 1's voice and conscienceHamilton dedicated his victory in Turkey to ""all the kids out there who dream the impossible.""In 2015, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff estimated that to traverse the many levels of motorsport -- from entry level karting, to Formula Renault, onto Formula 3, GP2 and then to F1 -- it would cost a driver €8 million ($9.4 million) total.Five years later, it seems fair to assume that that figure will only have increased.PA media's F1 correspondent Phil Duncan believes the sport is fortunate to have had even one champion of the caliber of Hamilton. ""It's almost incredible that we've actually had one [Lewis Hamilton] in the first place, really,"" he tells CNN Sport. ""He got there because he was good, but in a way [he is] fortunate that he was picked up by McLaren and Mercedes at 13, who were then effectively able to bankroll his future career.""Prior to being signed to McLaren by Ron Dennis, Hamilton's father Anthony famously remortgaged his house three-times and, at times, held four jobs to fund his son's karting career. But unless a driver's parents' house is valued at a few million dollars, that may not be a possible route nowadays.Hamilton's father, Anthony, remortgaged his house three-times to raise money for his son's junior karting career.In 2019, Hamilton lamented the lack of working-class drivers making it to the grid, saying: ""There are very few, if [any] working-class families on their way up. It's all wealthy families.""I've got a friend of mine who was nearly in Formula One and then he got leapfrogged by a wealthy kid and then his opportunity was gone.""Hamilton was extremely successful as a junior in karting, and was signed for McLaren by Ron Dennis at the age of 13. Traveling to races in a caravanCurrent Renault driver Esteban Ocon matches Hamilton's background, albeit from across the English Channel. The 24-year old's parents sold their house to fund Ocon's karting passion, he revealed to Reuters in 2017. The family lived and traveled to races in a caravan that, when not at race weekends, they would park in front of Ocon's school.He didn't mind the lifestyle, saying, ""I was 11 or 12 or something. I was happy to live in the caravan back then. I was enjoying my life, I was doing karting all the time and it was awesome for me.""But, like Hamilton, without the immense sacrifice of his parents, he would not have been able to continue in karting.The same goes for Hamilton's fellow seven-time world champion Schumacher.     Schumacher's bricklayer father Rolf reportedly built his son's first kart from scrap. To continue funding Michael's karting career, Rolf took a second job working as a mechanic on other people's karts, before the future champion was discovered by sponsors.Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel has also said in the past that his career would have ended pretty soon after it began if the costs were the same back when he was a junior in karting to what they are now.Without Hamilton, Schumacher and Vettel, F1 loses the winners of a combined 18 world championship over the last 27 years.Like Hamilton, the parents of Michael Schumacher (right) made tremendous sacrifices to fund their son's fledgling karting career as a child, while Sebastian Vettel (left) has said he may not have made it as a professional driver were the costs the same when he was a junior as they are now.The backing of billionaire fathersThat is not to say current drivers blessed with substantial financial backing throughout their lives do not deserve their seats. Drivers like Lance Stroll -- who surprisingly achieved pole position for the Turkish Grand Prix -- and Nicholas Latifi both received the financial backing of their billionaire fathers.Indeed, in the case of Stroll's father Lawrence, he bought the F1 team for which his son drives.Despite a string of disappointing finishes recently, Stroll took his team's only podium finish in 2020, at the Italian Grand Prix. The podium was also the second of his career, having recorded a podium finish as a rookie with his previous team Williams F1 at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Lance Stroll (right) celebrates on the podium at this year's Italian GP.Stroll has indicated he tries to ignore criticisms of an apparent easier route to the top, saying: ""I've heard all the noise and heard it my whole life to be honest, so I stay in my little bubble and keep the people that really matter close to me and the rest is just background noise. I just try to do my talking on the track.""Rookie driver Latifi is striving to make his mark while driving one of the slowest cars on the 20-car grid. Yet, despite this, he has twice finished 11th -- one place away from a points finish.Mercedes team principal Wolff says that drivers like Stroll face ""stigma"" because of their wealthy background even when they have the results to back up their selection.Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team's Team Chief Toto Wolff says drivers from wealthy backgrounds like Stroll face ""stigma.""Referring to Stroll, Wolff said: ""He won the Italian F4 championship, won the European F3 championship, has been on the podium twice, and has qualified for the first row in Monza in the rain.""I don't think we can say just because his father is a billionaire that he's not here on merit, right? It's even more impressive that a kid with that environment chooses one of the most competitive sports in the world.""'Born into the sport'It isn't just Stroll and Latifi who have never had to struggle financially. The father of McLaren's Lando Norris, 21, retired at the age of 36, having sold his pensions company and amassing a fortune worth a reported $250 million.And many of the sport's other young talents were effectively born into the sport. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, 23, Red Bull's Max Verstappen, 23, Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly, 24, and McLaren's Carlos Sainz, 26, all had fathers and other family members who competed, at various levels, in professional motorsport. That's 20% of the current grid.(From top-left clockwise) Pierre Gasly, Carlos Sainz, Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc all had fathers and other family members who competed in professional motorsport before they entered the sport themselves.But Duncan says it is a costly sport for even those with motorsport pedigree.  ""I spoke to [1996 world champion] Damon Hill earlier this year and he was telling me about the eye-watering sums that he used to have to put aside for his son when he was karting,"" Duncan says of the English driver whose father was also a former F1 champion. ""He was saying he was costing him a hundred thousand [pounds] a year ($131,000). ""If a world champion, whose father [Graham Hill] won two world championships, is saying how difficult it is to have the money to be able to allow his son to race it shows you just how expensive it is and how difficult it is to get into this sport.""Apart from Ocon, arguably only Red Bull's Alex Albon, 24, faced challenges other young drivers have not. On his way up the ranks, he had to fight for every sponsor. His final step up to F1 was unexpected, as he had been signed to the Toro Rosso team after he had already committed to joining Formula E.The majority of current drivers, therefore, didn't face immediate financial difficulties when entering the sport at a young age. And, without financial backing, the door into elite motorsport -- and the chance to prove one's talent -- is still closed to the vast majority in society. What steps are being taken?In June, F1 launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative, and with it a new Task Force which aims to ""increase diversity and inclusion in the sport."" Initial funding of $1 million came personally from F1 Chairman and CEO Chase Carey. The sport had previously set out its goal to attract more diverse talent across technical, commercial, corporate, and on-air roles.As part of the initiative, F1 says, in partnership with the governing body, the FIA, it hopes to create ""a diverse driver talent pipeline by identifying and systematically eliminating barriers to entry from grassroots karting to Formula 1."" The FIA also donated an additional €1 million ($1.18 million) to the pot.The FIA safety car used during Formula 1 events this year has been branded with the 'WeRaceAsOne' logo.Asked how this money directly translated into giving people from non-wealthy backgrounds a chance break into motorsport, F1 told CNN that the sport aimed to ""reflect the world in which we race."" ""That means starting from the grassroots level to remove any barriers for participation in karting, making it as accessible as possible for people from all backgrounds,"" a spokesperson said via email. ""We are exploring ways to make karting more affordable and accessible and working with the FIA to develop a structured pathway to single-seater racing.""While F1 said it hoped the initiative would ""encourage people from underrepresented background"" to race, the sport also wanted its efforts to have an impact beyond the track, offering opportunities ""through engineering scholarships, internships throughout the organization and working closely with the teams to provide as many avenues as we can into the industry.""Former Ferrari and Williams F1 engineer Rob Smedley is involved in another initiative, the Electroheads Motorsport karting series.The karts used in Electroheads Motorsport offer performance parity for significantly lower running costs, meaning talent is the most important factor to being a successful racing driver.Smedley, who is CEO of Electroheads Motorsport, says a desire for a truly meritocratic and democratic form of karting is at the heart of the series.READ: Ella Stevens: The 13-year-old aiming to become Ferrari's first female Formula 1 driverThe Electroheads Motorsport karts are made with equal power and specifications, so talent is the only differentiator between competitors.""The main thing that I always talk about is democracy,"" he tells CNN. ""You want to democratize it because motorsport should be for the many, not for the few.""At the lower levels of karting, open-ended budgets create a disparity in the competition, with Smedley saying costs ""can tend to spiral,"" even at grassroots. ""If your budget is big enough, you can buy up all of the best engine(s) and there's other levels of performance that you can effectively procure,"" he says.Rob Smedley (right) was previously the race engineer for Felipe Massa (left) at Ferrari and Williams F1, before he founded Electroheads and became director of data systems for F1.That effectively creates a system where the fastest drivers will be in the fastest karts. That does not necessarily equate to them being the most talented drivers.""The genesis of it all has to be done with the grassroots to make that more accessible to more people,"" says Smedley.""Then, the chances are that you've got a big catching net where you can find this talent and talent shouldn't be defined by budget. ""Budget should be secondary, or should be more accessible at least, and it has to be talent first. ""It's about being much more meritocratic than perhaps we are now because the barriers of entry are so big, and basically give the opportunity to the people who normally wouldn't get it.""Will F1 ever be more diverse?Hamilton has said that when he does leave F1 he wants to leave behind a more diverse sport.""I'm just trying to think about what I can do, and diversity is a continuous issue, and will continue to be an issue for a long time, and there's only a certain amount I can do,"" he said.""I am trying to think about what it is I can actually do and work with, and how I can work with F1, rather than it just be a tick on their list of things to add to 'we also do' -- which businesses often do, and actually have something that is really implemented and actually making an impactful difference.""Hamilton has said that when he retires, he wants to leave behind a more diverse sport.Smedley, who is also director of data systems for F1, believes the sport isn't making empty promises with its financial pledges to increase diversity and equality of opportunity, and is doing ""a brilliant job.""""It's [Formula 1] trying to look at every single level and look at how you make a difference, and how you make systemic change,"" he says. ""We're just at the start of the journey, so hopefully more and more fantastic things continue to happen.""Duncan agrees, saying: ""As it stands, the current system is still in place and it is costing parents tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to get their children in a position to be able to go racing.""That's ruling out pretty much most of the population because most people don't have that cash just lying around. So there needs to be a change.""Lewis Hamilton is still the only Black driver ever to have raced in Formula 1.However, Duncan does not believe change will happen soon -- unless drastic action is taken.""I can't see anything really changing for the next generation at least,"" he says.""We saw someone like Lewis come through as a young Black guy in 2007. It's now 2020 and the makeup of the grid is pretty similar to how it was when Lewis started. ""So, although he's been a trailblazer, it hasn't exactly paved the way for similar kids in a similar position to make it into F1.""Smedley is more confident than Duncan that there will be another working-class driver achieving excellence in F1, saying the sport's commitment to increasing diversity and opportunity has ""gathered at an alarming pace"" in the past two years.""I think that the time is right for change and the time is right for the systemic change,"" he says. ""But it's got to be that systemic change. You've got to change the system if you're going to actually move the needle. ""The next Lewis Hamilton, or the next person of color either running a team or winning a world championship ... you've got to have that change for that to be effective. But I'm convinced that it will happen.""",2020-11-17T09:48:40Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/motorsport/lewis-hamilton-world-champion-diversity-inclusion-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,2020-11-18 08:51:11.480359,CNN,sports,0
Who will Trump grant his first post-election interview to? Here are some possibilities,"A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.Election Day was November 3rd. Major news orgs called it November 7th. And yet, more than a week later, we haven't seen much of Trump. Yes, he has been active — to say the least — on Twitter. And yes, he did speak about Operation Warp Speed from the Rose Garden recently. But that's it.Trump hasn't taken any questions about the results of the 2020 election. He hasn't called into ""Fox & Friends"" or dialed into Rush Limbaugh's show. And his schedule has been largely void of public events since Americans rejected him at the ballot box.So when might that end? When will Trump give his first post-election interview? And on what medium?Typically, one might imagine that Trump would appear on Fox News. Perhaps he'd call into the ""Friends"" or record a sit-down chat with Sean Hannity. But if one thing has been made clear lately, it is that Trump is livid at Fox. He's repeatedly raged against the network and promoted its rivals, such as Newsmax and OAN. Talk, however, is cheap. Which is to say, if Trump wants to preach what he teaches, he won't do Fox.Read MoreSo what are Trump's other options? He could always surprise everyone and sit down with a major news network. Or he could call into Limbaugh's show, which seems like an obvious choice. Or he could drive a dagger into Fox...""We would be open to an interview""If Trump really wants to hit Fox, he'd appear on Newsmax, maybe sitting down for an interview with Greg Kelly who has seen a ratings surge over the past week. I texted Newsmax boss Chris Ruddy to see if there have been any conversations behind-the scenes. Ruddy told me that he last spoke to Trump last Thursday when he called to congratulate him on Newsmax's recent ratings success. ""I mentioned to him that we would be open to an interview,"" Ruddy said. ""He said that everybody's asking him for one but that he's really focused right now on dealing with the election challenges."">> Trump last appeared on Newsmax when he spoke with Kelly just before the election...Speaking of which...When will we see President-elect Joe Biden sit down for a post-election interview? Yes, Biden has been more accessible than Trump, giving speeches and taking questions from reporters. But that's not quite the same as sitting down for a lengthy interview.

'Mitra' the robot is helping India's Covid patients,"In India, the country with the world's second-highest number of Covid-19 cases, a handful of hospitals has started to use robots to connect patients with their loved ones, and assist healthcare workers on the frontlines of the pandemic. Bangalore-based Invento Robotics has designed three robots to carry out tasks ranging from disinfecting surfaces to answering patient questions and enabling video consultations with doctors. Of the eight the company has so far deployed, the most popular model is Mitra, which means friend in Hindi and costs around $10,000. Using facial-recognition technology, the robot can recall the names and faces of patients it has interacted with. Mitra can roam around a hospital independently, helping patients connect with family and doctors via its cameras and a video screen attached to its chest.""Mitra can be the nurse's or doctor's assistant, take readings and vitals, remind them of medications,"" says Balaji Viswanathan, CEO of Invento Robotics.He says the human-like robot engages with patients and gains their trust. ""It may sound ironic but we are using robots to bring humanity to hospitals,"" he tells CNN Business. Read MoreYatharth Hospital in the city of Noida, northern India, has deployed two Mitra robots — one at its entrance to screen patients for coronavirus symptoms and the other in the intensive care unit.""Inside our ICU [Mitra] helps patients connect with their families through video stream and gives the patient's family a look inside,"" hospital director Kapil Tyagi tells CNN Business. ""Patients get happy and positive whenever the robot visits them. They are often clicking selfies with Mitra,"" he says. Viswanathan says Invento uses ""best in class security"" for video feeds between doctors, patients and their families. For in-depth telemedicine consultations, a booth is built around the robot to give patients privacy.Coronavirus pivotViswanathan and his wife Mahalakshmi Radhakrushnun moved to Bangalore in 2016 from Boston, USA, where Viswanathan was completing a PhD in human robot interaction and Radhakrushnan was working in manufacturing. They wanted to combine their experience to create robots that improved patient care in hospitals and care homes, but they struggled to find customers.

""When coronavirus hit, hospitals finally understood what we were talking about."" India has had more than 8 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 120,000 deaths. Hospitals have struggled to cope, and Invento isn't the only robotics company that is helping out. Milagrow Robotics specializes in home cleaning robots, but has deployed five humanoid cleaning robots to Indian hospitals during the pandemic, while Kerala-based Asimov Robotics has created a robot to dispense medicine and clean up after patients.Producing robots during the pandemic has been challenging, says Viswanathan. When India went into lockdown in March, non-essential businesses closed and his company struggled to secure materials from suppliers. ""There was a three to four-month delay. Manufacturing was a huge headache,"" he adds.But his company is starting to deliver on its mission of improving patient care.

South Dakota coronavirus: The state is grappling with the nation's highest postivity rate,"Chris and John Bjorkman bought their home in De Smet, South Dakota, less than a year ago. The couple, who celebrated their 39th anniversary last June, thought they would spend the rest of their lives together on the idyllic land, home to the ""Little House on the Prairie"" Laura Ingalls homestead.The small town, home to just over 1,000 people, according to the 2019 census estimates, is about 100 miles northwest of Sioux Falls.As the couple renovated their new home, they took caution to avoid the Covid-19 virus that swept the world into a pandemic in March. Despite keeping mostly to themselves, they both tested positive in September.Wearing masks could save more than 100,000 US lives through February, new study suggests""We wore masks all the time. We wore masks, we stayed home,"" Chris Bjorkman told CNN. ""We were more worried about me. I have several underlying conditions. He didn't.""But she survived. Her husband, a healthy 66-year-old, did not. Read More""He yelled that he had fallen,"" Bjorkman recalled. As she went to help him, he told her he couldn't breathe.She took John to a hospital, but he was transported out of state just a few hours later. ""He was flown out to Marshall, Minnesota, because they said the Sioux Falls hospital was full at the time.""John Bjorkman is one of 644 people who have died in South Dakota -- where the per capita Covid-19 rate leads above any other state in the country. The seven-day positivity rate is also alarmingly high -- at nearly 60%, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project -- higher than any other state in the US, which has seen more than 11 million people infected and over 247,000 killed by the virus.The South Dakota governor's office disputed CTP's positivity rate, instead saying theirs is just over 21%, according to the state's Department of Health data. South Dakota does not provide the number of new tests that were administered in a single day, making it impossible to tabulate a 7-day average and get a complete view on the positivity rate. ""When they flew me over here, I literally didn't know ... if I would see the next day,"" John said through tears in a video call shortly after being transported. ""It makes me nervous. Literally, it could be December, January, before I get up, play a little bit with my grandson.""Chris Bjorkman holds up a quilt with photos of her late husband.While John fought for his life in the hospital, his wife tried to speed up the renovations at home, so that he would have a comfortable place to recover. He had been given Remdesivir and started to get better. He was even taken back to South Dakota as his condition improved. He died on October 20.""I never thought he would not make it,"" Bjorkman said holding back tears. ""I always thought he was going to come home ... I knew he might be in a wheelchair or something, but I just wanted him to come home.""She now holds onto her memories of her late husband as she sits in what was supposed to be their home. ""I just miss him, I miss all the things that he did,"" Bjorkman said. ""He was a very positive person ... He was always happy, ready to go, ready to conquer the day. I mean, that was just John.""Bjorkman said her husband was always helping people, especially the children at the schools where he worked. ""When he was in education, he was always going out of his way for kids and stuff. Finding them tennis shoes or glasses if their parents couldn't afford it,"" she told CNN. ""He was a good person.""Bjorkman told CNN she's speaking out because she knows if John were alive, he would still try to help people by telling them how deadly this virus can be.""People need to take this very serious. And a lot of people don't, and we just need some kind of leadership in this state to help us get through this time,"" she said. ""We have no one telling us what to do and I think some people need that ... They need to be told to wear a mask.""""People need to wear masks and they just need to social distance,"" Bjorkman said people should limit their interactions, social distance and wear a mask because ""you don't know who is gonna survive it.""South Dakota has highest positivity rate in the USMore than 62,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus and over 3,500 have been hospitalized, according to the state's Covid-19 website. But as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue to rise, rural areas are being hit the hardest despite lower populations and density.According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rural Americans are dying at rates 3.45 times higher than Americans living in metropolitan areas.This Republican governor is playing politics while Covid-19 burns through her stateAs of November 13, according to the CDC's data, the seven-day death rate per 100,000 people for Americans living in large metro areas is 0.2, while in rural areas it is 0.69. The national average seven-day death rate is 0.33.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem never issued a stay-at-home order, and as people continue to get sick and die, says she will not mandate mask wearing. Over the summer, the state hosted thousands at the Sturgis motorcycle rally, which has since been linked to dozens of cases of the virus and at least one death as well as a mostly maskless Trump rally in July.Gov. Noem's office did not respond to a request by CNN on Monday and declined to join ""New Day"" for an on-air interview that morning.A few weeks ago, while attending a Trump rally, the governor claimed people in her state were happy. ""The only reason you know who I am today is because the liberals have been busy kicking me in the head for all the decisions I've made for my people in South Dakota. But let me tell you, my people are happy. They're happy because they're free.""Frontline health care workers say hospitals reaching capacityAlthough the governor feels no mask mandate is needed, health care workers told CNN they believe that could be the only way to curb the uncontrolled spread of the virus.Former US Air Force veteran Dr. Shannon Emry wants a mask mandate to help mitigate the rapid increase in cases she's seen.The pandemic has become a humanitarian disaster in the United States""Our governor has been misleading her constituents. From the start, she has downplayed the dangers of the virus, downplayed the importance of wearing a mask and it has really undermined the people's trust in their medical community,"" Emry said. ""And by doing that, she's putting people in danger.""Emry said the lack of restrictions has left the state powerless to control the deadly virus.""Our hospital systems across the state are already at capacity, are already at this critical state,"" she said. ""The health care workers are obviously exhausted and the devastating thing for them is that we don't see an end in sight. There's not a stop date, there's not a timeline.""Jodi Doering, an emergency room nurse, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" on Monday morning that she's seeing many people in her state in denial over their Covid-19 diagnoses, and are often angry in the last moments of their lives when they could be talking to loved ones. ""Even if positive results come back, some people just don't believe it,"" she said, adding that they sometimes will insist it's something else like the flu, a cold or even lung cancer. US may not be back to normal until 2022, Fauci says ""It's hard and sad because every hospital, every nurse, every doctor in this state is seeing the same things. These people get sick in the same way, you treat them in the same way, they die in the same way. And then you do it over again,"" Doering told CNN. ""It just makes you mad and sad and frustrated.""Doering wants people to recognize the cost and the severity of this virus in South Dakota and take steps to protect themselves so that they don't end up in the hospital, where ""it might be too late.""Update: After this story published, the governor's office disputed the 60% positivity rate from the COVID Tracking Project. This story has been updated with information about how South Dakota calculates the state's positivity rate.",2020-11-17T15:51:35Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/us/south-dakota-covid-surge/index.html,2020-11-18 09:08:51.582346,CNN,politics,0
"Two weeks after the election, far-right TV shows are providing false hope to Trump fans","A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.We have reached the tragic endpoint of President Trump's war on truth.Two weeks after Election Day, Trump and his media allies continue to contest the results. Baseless ""Trump won"" conspiracy theories continue to fill up social media feeds and far-right-wing TV shows. Call me naive, but I kind of thought this shtick would start to subside by now! But it is actually getting worse as time goes on. CNN.com's lead headline captured it on Monday night: ""Trump aims to undermine Biden's legitimacy as legal challenges fizzle.""There is an understandable reticence to give oxygen to this stuff. As CNN's Daniel Dale noted on Monday, ""almost nothing Trump is saying about the election is true.""But it's still seeping into the groundwater, like contamination from an overturned tanker truck. Millions of people are hearing what Newsmax hosts and guests are saying. One America News shows are trying to one-up Newsmax. And Fox News shows are reacting to this far-right pressure. So let me walk you through what's being said and who's being smeared...Read MoreNewsmax's narrativeI watched several hours of Newsmax TV on Monday to soak up the channel's messaging. This quote from 7pm host Greg Kelly summed it all up: ""This is not over. Ignore what the mainstream media is telling you right now.""Greg Kelly on NewsmaxNewsmax's narrative is that the election is not over, the media is wrong, Biden is weak, and Trump is strong. The channel's CEO Chris Ruddy says ""Newsmax will accept state results and the Electoral College when certified,"" but until then it is operating in a fictional universe where Trump still has a path to victory. It is bashing Fox News and snaring some disaffected Fox viewers: Last Friday the channel averaged 700,000+ viewers from 4 to 8pm, up from 100,000 on a good day prior to the election.On Monday night, Kelly alternated between playing dumb and playing confident. One minute he self-assuredly said ""it's not over yet"" and ""these things are still under review"" and, regarding Biden, ""I don't think he will be president."" The next minute he ignorantly asked why Trump's ""I won"" posts were being flagged by Twitter, but Biden's posts were not, when Twitter's policy about election claims is public for all to see. He basically did a dumbed-down version of Sean Hannity's show, complete with aggrieved banners like ""TRUMP SUPPORTERS ATTACKED"" and ""MICHELLE OBAMA IS SO BORING."" I was amused by the banner that said ""MSM CALLING TRUMP A LIAR"" because there is nothing controversial about media figures covering Trump's lies. But in the pro-Trump fictional universe, the people correcting the lies are the liars...Far-right shows provide false hopeAccording to Newsmax's talk shows, the president is still in it to win it, and big breaking news might be right around the corner. I can see why this coverage is exciting, even though it's a lie. Kelly's guests on Monday night were Trump lawyers Victoria Toensing and Jenna Ellis and strategist Dick Morris. Kelly assured the audience that ""the president has some of the best lawyers in the country working for him."" Morris boldly stated that ""I believe that this election was absolutely stolen."" Kelly responded, ""I agree with you,"" and ""I feel like something is going to break our way, in a big way, very very soon."" Later in the hour, he told Ellis that ""tens of millions are rooting for you.""In the real world, Trump's longshot lawsuits are falling apart. Lawyers are quitting. But Newsmax is offering an alternative: A fantasyland where, in the words of 8pm host Grant Stinchfield's first guest, convicted liar Roger Stone, ""it's pretty evident that President Trump actually won a majority of all legal votes cast.""Stinchfield cloaked himself in a facts-first mentality: ""All anybody wants is the truth. that's all we're asking for."" Then he claimed, without a shred of evidence, that ""more than a million Trump supporters descended on DC"" over the weekend. One has to wonder how these viewers will react when Biden's win IS certified and this false hope fizzles out...What about One America News?Trump has promoted OANN more than Newsmax over the years, and he did so again on Monday, tweeting ""Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!"" However, the channel has not capitalized on the appetite for election denialism quite as much as Newsmax has, sources at the channel told me. Some shows have emphasized that OANN hasn't called the election yet. (This claim is meaningless since the channel doesn't have a decision desk.) Some talk show hosts have moved on and attacked Biden's transition team, while others have zoomed in on voter fraud fantasies. ""We must stop the steal now,"" 9pm host Kara McKinney said in a promo on Monday.Is this stuff working? Well, OANN is not rated by Nielsen, so we don't know. But Newsmax IS rated, and its shows are putting newfound pressure on Fox. At 7pm on Friday, for instance, Kelly averaged 168,000 viewers in the key cable news demo of 25- to 54-year-olds, while Martha MacCallum's Fox show ""The Story"" averaged 328,000 viewers in the demo. CNN was way ahead of both channels with 651,000 viewers in the demo for ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Fox is not used to being in this position -- losing to CNN, and feeling pressure from far-right challengers. In response, the network is loudly touting its prime time lineup, showcasing promos that say they're ""standing up for what's right...""is Fox expanding Tucker's show?Some curious comments from Tucker Carlson on Fox News Monday night: ""Over the weekend we got a lot of calls asking if we're leaving Fox News. Ironically, at that very moment, we were working on a project to expand the amount of reporting and analysis we do in this hour across other parts of the company.""What was Carlson talking about? It's unclear. I was unaware of any chatter about Carlson leaving Fox. He seemed to be reacting to a fake post on Parler. But he told his viewers, ""This show is not going anywhere. It's getting bigger. The people who run Fox News want more of it, not less, and we are grateful for that. We'll have specifics soon."" Okay, how soon?",2020-11-17T05:43:03Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/17/media/far-right-tv-shows-trump-reliable-sources/index.html,2020-11-17 10:36:51.039643,CNN,politics,0
Seve Ballesteros: Remembering the Spaniard's magnificent Masters triumph at Augusta,"Augusta National is a sporting stage unlike any other. It is a place where tradition is valued above all else and the sacred Green Jacket, handed to the Masters winner each year, gives the golf major a familiarity that is unique in sport. But some of that familiarity will be broken this year, especially as the coronavirus pandemic precipitated a re-schedule from the tournament's usual April spot in the sporting calendar to November for the first time in its 86-year history. It's fitting perhaps that this Augusta first comes on the 40th anniversary of one of the greatest moments in Masters history when Seve Ballesteros became the first European to claim the most coveted prize in golf.Ballesteros gets the Masters green jacket from last year's winner, Fuzzy Zoeller, after winning the 1980 Masters.READ: Rahm skips ball across pond in amazing hole-in-one at the MastersRead MoreBeginnings Having turned professional in 1974, aged 16, Ballesteros' talent had been evident to European circles for a number of years, even before he announce himself on the world stage by claiming his first major title in 1979, winning The Open Championship at Royal Lytham.""We in America got our first glimpse of Seve in 1976 when he finished runner-up in The Open at Birkdale,"" Ben Crenshaw, one of the pre-tournament favourites to claim the Green Jacket at Augusta in 1980, tells CNN Living Golf host, Shane O'Donoghue. ""We could see this player, this handsome dashing player, who played with such verve and power ... it was like Arnold Palmer reincarnated on the coast of Spain."" The confidence gleaned from his first Open Championship win, combined with his natural ability, meant Ballesteros was riding high ahead of the 1980 Masters.Just three weeks before, he had finished third at the PGA Tour's Players' Championship, a couple of strokes behind winner Lee Trevino. On the eve of the tournament, and celebrating his 23rd birthday, asked how he was feeling, he told the media: ""I'm ready to go.""READ: How Bryson DeChambeau is making rivals rethink their approach to golfBallesteros celebrates after winning the British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Anne's in Lancashire, United Kingdom.A strong startBallesteros quikcly showed the Augusta patrons he meant business, putting together a near-faultless first round that left him tied for first place at six-under par. ""At that point, he hadn't really played in the United States that much. So, what sort of surprised people was that he was able to just swashbuckle his way around in the way that he did,"" Crenshaw explained. ""Augusta was the most beautiful palette upon which he could paint these pictures in his mind. It was made for Seve."" Ballesteros followed up his opening day 66 with rounds of 69 and 68 on Friday and Saturday respectively, taking an incredible seven-stroke lead into the final day. Despite being one of the youngest competing, the 23-year-old was on course to break the course's 72-hole record.READ: How Jack Nicklaus' sixth Masters win aged 46 tops Tiger Woods' redemption taleBallesteros during the 1976 Open Championship.The final dayOn the final day, Ballesteros sauntered through the front nine and extended his lead. ""There's a cliché which goes that the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday and, in 1980, come the back nine on Sunday, it looked like it was all over. Seve led by 10 shots,"" Ballesteros' biographer Robert Green told Living Golf.""I'm sure he knew he'd got it won, everybody knew he'd got it won, there's no drama -- then, four holes later, he leads by just three. He'd dropped four shots in four holes and Jack Newton had made three birdies in three holes and, suddenly, what had seemed like an unassailable lead had all but drifted away."" With his lead wilting around the iconic Amen corner, Ballesteros required all the determination and desire he could muster. ""Jack Newton was a wonderful player from Australia and Seve and Jack had this great battle,"" Crenshaw said.According to Green, when a player loses control at Augusta a round can ""get away from you very fast,"" which is what was threatening to happen to Ballesteros.  Ballesteros putts during the third round of the 1980 Masters.READ: Rory McIlroy bids to join golf's greats with career grand slam at Masters""It just shows me that Augusta, more than anywhere else, how particularly those water-strewn holes on the back nine, that it can get away from you very fast, if things go wrong,"" Green explains. Few knew Ballesteros better than Billy Foster, his caddy from 1991 to 1995. ""I've caddied for nearly 30 years, there's no other golfer that I've ever met to this day that showed the determination, the grit, the desire -- I've seen him biting grips in tears,"" the Englishman told CNN in 2016.""He just loved the game and it meant everything to him, it was his life.""  After his nightmare run of bogeys through Amen Corner -- a term coined by sports writer Herbert Warren Wind in 1958 for the 11th, 12th and the tee shot on the 13th hole --  Ballesteros astonishingly birdied the 15th and got home safely, winning by four strokes at 13-under par.In one of the most remarkable Sunday's in Masters history, Augusta had crowned one of the most remarkable champions in its history. Speaking to CNN five years before his death in 2011, Ballesteros outlined the characteristics he needed to become a Masters champion. ""To be a winner, it takes a lot of things -- it takes talent obviously, it takes time to develop that talent, discipline, determination, desire ... and good nerves."" READ: DeChambeau hoping lack of patrons at Masters can give him 'bit of an advantage'Ballesteros in action in 1984.The legacyBallesteros' dramatic victory opened the door for a host of other European golfers to succeed on the biggest of stages. ""I really believe that without Seve, it would have taken maybe 20 or 30 years more for the European game to be where we are today,"" Ballesteros' friend, Jose Maria Olazabal, who would himself won two Green Jackets, told Living Golf as he reflected on the 40th anniversary. Despite his magnificent triumph in 1980, however, Ballesteros was not yet well known in his homeland.""I think what would have hurt him the most was that there would be essentially no acknowledgment of his achievement in Spain because, generally, people in Spain weren't interested in golf,"" Green explained.Manuel Pinero, Ballesteros, Jose Maria Canizares and Jose Rivero celebrate Europe winning the 26th Ryder Cup in 1985.READ: What a Masters like no other might be likeWith a pained expression, Olazabal said: ""I remember, I was told by him that when he won the Open Championship [in 1979] for instance, the TV cut the images when he was in contention to win the event with four or five holes to go so that they could show a horse race.""As his career progressed, the Spanish public not only warmed to Ballesteros but also to the sport of golf, thanks mainly to Ballesteros' magnetic personality and success. The adoration was evident during the euphoric scenes at Valderama in 1997 as Ballesteros captained the European team to a dramatic Ryder Cup victory on his home soil over the Americans.There is perhaps no greater example of Ballesteros' legacy in Spain than current world No. 2 Jon Rahm, one of the favorites to claim the Green Jacket this year.""Because of that 1997 Ryder Cup, and that Seve spirit, that aura, that something that Seve had, my family started playing golf and I'm here because of it,"" Rahm said. ""He was a pioneer of golf, not only in Spain but Europe, and when I tell people they don't usually believe me. When he started playing golf, I think there was about 15,000 people that were licensed to play golf in Spain, when he died there was 350,000 people.""Olazabal uses the shoulders of Ballesteros to get a better view of the hole during the 29th Ryder Cup in 1991. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIt's been a spectacular year for Rahm, as he became the only Spaniard, other than Ballesteros, to reach the world No. 1 spot. If he wins the Green Jacket, he'll be the third Spaniard to follow in Ballesteros' footsteps  -- after Olazabal and Sergio Garcia.""It's crazy to think of his story, right? I mean, [he] started as a caddy with one club and made it all the way to the pros, goes to Augusta and is the first European to win the Masters. It's unbelievable.""

'Grey's Anatomy' features surprise return in season premiere shocker,"It's a McDream come true.  Patrick Dempsey's Derek Shepherd made a shocking return in the season premiere of ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy,"" sending longtime viewers into a frenzy on Thursday night over the reappearance of the deceased character. For those who missed it, the two-hour episode was both a catch-up and an introduction to the world of ""Grey's Anatomy"" amid coronavirus. The pandemic portions of the episode were set in April 2020, just weeks into the global health emergency that in real life shuttered production on the series back in March, before they could finish filming the final episodes of their season.In the episode, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) spends most of her time fully suited up in PPE and treating patients in the Covid ward at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. At the end of the episode, Meredith is found by another doctor having collapsed in the parking lot. Read MoreBefore more information on her condition could be made clear, the action switches to a beach, where Meredith is standing watching the waves. As her voice over ends, she hears a voice calling her name and turns to see her dead husband standing down the shore, waving his arms.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Grey's Anatomy Official (@greysabc) Dempsey's character was killed off in season 11 and has only been seen in archival footage since. A preview for next week's episode hints that there will be more to see from Meredith and Derek's on-screen reunion but does little to clear up the context of it. Is it a coma dream? A near-death experience? A hallucination? To be determined. Pompeo was cagey in her post-episode appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" But said putting it together was rewarding because they knew that viewers were ""going to freak out."" ""And we all know 2020 has been a really long, ugly road. And we were so happy just to be able to film these scenes and know how much joy it was going to bring people,"" she said. ""Grey's Anatomy"" airs Thursdays on ABC.

RCEP: China signs huge Asia Pacific trade deal with 14 countries,"China has just joined forces with more than a dozen countries across the Asia Pacific region to sign a huge free trade deal nearly a decade in the making. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership spans 15 countries and 2.2 billion people, or nearly 30% of the world's population, according to a joint statement released by the nations on Sunday, when the deal was signed. Their combined GDP totals roughly $26 trillion and they account for nearly 28% of global trade based on 2019 data. The deal includes several of the region's heaviest economic hitters aside from China, including Japan and South Korea. New Zealand and Australia are also partners, as are Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia.The trade agreement was first proposed in 2012 as a way to create one of the world's largest free-trade zones. It's tough to gauge the immediate economic significance of the deal. The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — a group of 10 countries that signed the agreement — said that it would eliminate tariffs and quotas on 65% of the goods that are traded in the region. Asia's economies are bouncing back. The West is headed in the other directionRead MoreThe partner countries also noted the importance of the agreement as the world tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, saying in a joint statement that the deal ""will play an important role in building the region's resilience through inclusive and sustainable post-pandemic economic recovery process.""""Its symbolic value has always exceeded its actual value,"" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. He pointed out that India opted out of the deal late last year, lessening the importance of the agreement in terms of actual trade. Reinsch said, though, that the agreement could have consequences in the long term, and added that China's involvement ""is a sign of its willingness to play a constructive role, despite its aggressive actions in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.""China and Australia, for example, have been caught up in trade disputes lately, but that hasn't stopped them pressing ahead with the RCEP. ""Both countries see huge benefits from their deeper economic integration with other Asian countries,"" said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS. ""The RCEP could potentially provide Beijing and Canberra another platform where they could discuss and hammer out their differences.""The US-China rivalry in tech and trade won't end because Joe Biden is presidentOthers noted that the deal was further evidence of Asia's growing power. Economists at HSBC said Sunday that the agreement ""signals that Asia keeps pushing ahead with trade liberalization even as other regions have become more skeptical.""""It may reinforce a trend that's been already underway for decades: that the global center of economic gravity keeps pushing relentlessly to the East,"" they wrote in a research note.Leaving the US behind?It's not clear whether the deal will have an impact on the most important global trading relationship of all: That between the United States and China, who have been fighting over trade and related issues for the last few years.""Whether it means a shift in the regional dynamic in favor of China depends on the US response,"" Reinsch said of the new trade deal. He pointed to the importance of the election of Joe Biden, who will succeed President Donald Trump in January. ""If the US continues to ignore or bully the countries there, the influence pendulum will swing toward China,"" he added. ""If Biden has a credible plan to restore the US presence and influence in the region, then the pendulum could swing back our way.""The United States famously bailed on the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a major trade deal that would have cemented stronger relationships with several countries in Asia Pacific, including Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — when Trump took office.  Since then, the United States has done some bilateral deals, including a 2018 agreement with South Korea and this year's truce with China. But it hasn't done a comprehensive regional trade agreement.""Given the shortcomings of RCEP, we would not recommend the United States joining,"" said Myron Brilliant, US Chamber of Commerce executive vice president and head of international affairs. ""The United States should however adopt a more forward-looking, strategic effort to maintain a solid US economic presence in the region. Otherwise, we risk being on the outside looking in as one of the world's primary engines of growth hums along without us,"" Brilliant added.— Jake Kwon and Akanksha Sharma contributed to this report.

Beyond Meat launches plant-based pork in China,"Beyond Meat (BYND) is launching a plant-based version of China's favorite meat.The California-based company unveiled its latest product on Wednesday: meatless minced ""pork."" The new product is intended to mimic the taste of the popular filling used in many Asian dishes, such as dumplings and spring rolls. Beyond says customers will be served its rendition as a ramen topping, and in dishes such as spaghetti and meatballs, spicy bolognaise, and biscuits and gravy. (The company has made plant-based pork before, though in the form of a sausage product.)Starting Wednesday, customers in Shanghai will be able to try the new product at five local restaurants for a limited time.""We're excited to launch Beyond Pork in China, marking a milestone for Beyond Meat,"" Candy Chan, the company's general manager for China, said in a statement. ""We are not only launching an entirely new product innovation, but our first plant-based meat product created specifically for the Chinese market.""Read MoreShe noted that the product's ""exclusive debut in China furthers Beyond Meat's commitment to this important market."" Beyond Meat serving its new crunchy pork ""bite"" at a tasting in China on Wednesday. Beyond's latest introduction could come as a welcome alternative for Chinese consumers, especially right now.China, which has long been the world's biggest consumer of pork, entered a major production crisis last year due to an outbreak of African swine fever. The disruption forced some consumers to temporarily switch to other types of meat.Before that, pork had accounted for about 70% of China's overall meat consumption, according to official Chinese data.This year, Chinese pig farmers have seen some recovery, allowing them to boost supply and ease prices, analysts at Rabobank wrote in a recent research report.But globally, ""producers face a challenging outlook, given rising feed costs, weaker economic trends, and slower export growth as China rebuilds its domestic hog supply,"" they wrote.Battle over ChinaBeyond has been on a roll in mainland China, a vast market that is seen as vital for the US company's growth. Earlier this year, the firm announced a partnership with Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) to bring Beyond Burgers to supermarket shelves in mainland China for the first time. It had also rolled out products in some of the country's most popular fast food chains, including KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. That came just weeks after the company unveiled a big tie-up with Starbucks (SBUX), to get its meatless pastas, lasagnes and wraps on Chinese menus.McDonald's announces new chicken sandwich and 'McPlant' burgerThe firm also recently struck a deal with a local food distributor, Sinodis, which will help the company supply restaurants and caterers in China.But for all its momentum, competition is fierce. While the fake meat trend is still taking shape in mainland China, Beyond is going up against other popular brands, including fellow California upstart Impossible Foods, which has signaled plans for its own launch there. Last month, Impossible launched its fake beef product in supermarkets in Hong Kong and Singapore, hoping to widen its footprint across Asia and tap into an increased demand for home cooking spurred by the pandemic.— Laura He contributed to this report.",2020-11-18T06:30:47Z,http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/business/beyond-meat-china-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-11-18 08:44:36.853875,CNN,technology,0
